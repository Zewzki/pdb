ReleaseDate,Band,Type,Album,Style,Rating,Comments
1/5,Panzerchrist,EP,All Witches Shall Burn,Blackened Death Metal,5.0,"The mid-off continues. Just some cookie cutter, copy/paste blackened death. No interesting riffs, no interesting melody, no interesting song structure, etc etc etc. It's boring me... I'm bored"
1/6,Emexis,LP,Hibris: desmesura y arrogancia,Heavy Metal,4.6,"Very mid spanish heavy metal. Extremely monotone, not interesting, not finishing."
1/8,Descensum,EP,The Medium,Technical Death Metal,7.0,"Just some good 'ol fashion symphonic-y, tech-y death metal. Pretty quick listen and pretty enjoyable for those who enjoy the genre. It's not earth-shattering and the vocals are a little weak IMO, but for how quick it is I think it's worth a listen."
1/9,Witherfall,EP,Where Do I Begin?,Progressive Power Metal,5.3,"More mid vibes. Not bad, just not particularly interesting or inspiring. Good musicianship and technicality but the songwriting is suuper bland"
1/10,Krvna,LP,The Rhythmus Of Death Eternal,Melodic Black Metal,5.2,"A very mid way to kick off the year. It's fine, its melo-black. Only good song is last track - Man of Iron"
1/10,Yrr,EP,Visions,Progressive Metal,6.2,"Decent songwriting and instrumentation, but hindered by mid mixing/vocal quality. Something about the vocals just isn't right, can't tell if its the mix, master, or performance. Otherwise it's a pretty standard listen with a few notable moments thrown in. Not much emotion in the music."
1/11,Pleximents,EP,Tales of Deception,Progressive Metal,8.0,"Super unique prog metal - effortlessly moves between a litany of styles. Kept me engaged the whole time, pretty enjoyable little EP."
1/12,No Terror in the Bang,LP,Heal,Progressive Metal,5.4,"Hard to put a label on this - has some hardcore-y elements, some progressive metal elements. Overall it's just kinda weird. They're clearly talented, but it just doesn't exactly appeal to me. Not sure I really get it."
1/12,Kid Cudi,LP,INSANO,Hip-Hop,7.3,"I dig the vibe and the sound, but overall it's a little lackluster for me. Not sure anything of his will be able to compete with Man On The Moon III. This album doesn't have the same catchy melodic choruses that make songs super memorable."
1/12,Grandmaster,LP,Black Sun,Heavy Metal,6.7,"One of the better 'heavy metal' albums i've heard in a while. Normally theyr'e super derivative and uninventive - trying to recapture a vibe from 30-40 years ago. This has decent riffing, decent melody, and a unique vocal style that I kinda dig. Nothing earthshattering, but I wasn't dying for it to be over either."
1/12,Scanner,LP,The Cosmic Race,Power Metal,4.4,"Some of the sickest album art I've ever seen, some of the lamest music I've ever heard. (exaggeration, but it's MID as hell) This is the style of heavy metal that 'Grandmaster' managed to avoid"
1/12,Ryujin,LP,Ryujin,Extreme Power Metal,5.1,"Its alright - kinda meh but innocent. Reminds me of Trollfest, a little silly but with an east-asian melodic styles rather than norwegian. Not really interesting but its technically sound, listenable, well produced - ya know, all the basics covered."
1/12,Narzissus,LP,Akt III: Erlosung,Black Metal,8.0,"Huge surprise! Didn't expect much from this at all, but super interesting. A lot of melodic black metal components, then they'll randomly throw in a gypsy jazz section, or a classical guitar section, or a slow and haunting passage. Will definitely listen again - I recommend."
1/12,Magnum,LP,Here Comes the Rain,Progressive Rock,6.6,This is a magnum album
1/12,Extinction A.D.,EP,Ruthless Intent,Crossover Thrash Metal,5.5,"Its, like, a decent crossover thrash EP. Short, sweet, to the point. No fuggin around. Never need to listen again."
1/12,Engulf,LP,The Dying Planet Weeps,Death Metal,5.6,"Some cool parts, nice soft passages, but overall pretty forgettable. Whence cometh the meh-breaker"
1/12,Animarum,EP,Machina,Progressive Death Metal,6.0,"Good ups and downs, but still lacking in anything that truly grabbed me. I like the variety but ya know..."
1/12,Alluvial,EP,Death Is But A Door,Progressive Death Metal,5.5,Disappointing - not interesting at all. Barely can call it prog. Fine i guess
1/16,Ribspreader,LP,Reap Humanity,Death Metal,4.2,"Pretty boring riffs, pretty lame vocals, just really not that impressive of an album. Points for good production and decent mixing, but that should be garaunteed these days. Will not listen again"
1/18,Dark Oath,LP,Ages Of Man,Melodic Death Metal,5.9,"Decent melo black metal. Pretty mono-tone, never really changes up the vibe. Its a passable listen with one or two intriguing parts, but not blowing any socks off."
1/17,Bloody Keep,LP,Rats Of Black Death,Melodic Black Metal,6.3,"Very interesting take on black metal - feel like they try to fuse the meme of black metal guy wish dungeon synth side project together. Lots of synthy key work going on, very very melodic, very.... bright almost? Its a unique listen and melodic black metal fans should appreciate it."
1/17,EVOLVE,LP,NEMOPHILIA,Industrial J-Metal,6.2,"Very.... noisy. Get's better as it goes on. Not a fan of the whole j-metal style in general, but theres some good variety on here. Still a little too noisy and sawtoothy for me at times."
1/19,Acadence,LP,Destruction Of The Gods,Instrumetal,4.9,It's just instrumetal
1/19,Underneath,LP,From the Gut of Gaia,Deathcore,7.2,"Just dumb stupid heavy. Good riffs, good breakdowns, insanity on the vox. Really good execution of the style IMO"
1/19,Corsair,LP,The Golden Heart,Pirate Metal,5.9,"It's alright. Kinda standard riffing, but decent vocals and thematics. It might be worth a listen but hard to say."
1/19,God Plays Dice,LP,Objectiveness,Metalcore,5.3,"Pretty standard metalcore IMO. The occasional cool riff/melody line, but overall nothing to report. Not my style. Well executed, well mixed, so points for that."
1/19,NGC 891,EP,NGC 891,Instrumetal,4.9,"Half decent instrumetal with a sub-par heavy metal song at the end. Some cool dream theater-esque synth parts around, but overall you can probably skip."
1/19,Andracca,LP,To Bare the Weight of Death,Melodic Black Metal,5.5,"It's good melo-black, but not great. Not really notable or ear catching, very one-note. If you like the genre, I think it's probably well executed."
1/19,Vemod,LP,The Deepening,Black Metal,7.8,Liked this more than I expected. I think atmospheric or progressive black metal might be the only style I can really get into these days. I intend to listen to this again - I really liked the ebbe and flow and think I'll recommend it.
1/19,Upon Stone,LP,Dead Mother Moon,Melodic Death Metal,5.3,Pretty raw in a way some may like. Its standard melo-death. You'll enjoy if you're a big melo-death fan but it's not groundbreaking by any stretch.
1/19,Sovereign,LP,Altered Realities,Death Metal,4.8,"Pretty standard death metal. Nothing crazy, but if you're real into death metal it'll probably get the job done."
1/19,Sgaile,LP,Traverse The Bealach,Post-Metal,6.1,"I like a lot of the vox, chord progressions, and guitar melodies. Feels pretty ""noisey"" i guess? Hard to describe, but theres a lot going on, and not in the way where theres a lot of complexity, just a lot of sound. Vocals are very one-note. Some very beautiful passages that I would want to stick around for longer. I don't dislike but probably won't listen again"
1/19,Saxon,LP,"Hell, Fire And Damnation",Heavy Metal,5.7,"Saxon is good at what they do and you have to give them credit for still consistently pumping out listenable music nearly 50 after they started. That being said, their sound is pretty stale on the whole. It's *good* for their style, but their style is old. You won't want to kill yourself listening, but you'll probably zone out and forget most of the album."
1/19,Resin Tomb,LP,Cerebral Puragotry,Sludge Metal,4.1,"Extremely high energy, more than I really wanted at my time of listening. I can see why somebody would like this, but personally the sludgey style often lacks musical components that I value - namely strong melodic components, interesting harmony, and distinc rhythm sections. It just feels like a garbled mess of sound from beginning to end and I really struggle with that sort of thing. They have a suspicious number of songs that are exactly 4:20 in length :thonk:"
1/19,Metalite,LP,Expedition One,Melodic Power Metal,6.8,"Flawless execution of a style that just doesn't do much for me. Very Dragonforce-y but with less shredding. It's actually, like, perfectly executed - just not really my thing. If you like female vox and sci-fi power metal, this is probably for you."
1/19,Master,LP,Saints Dispelled,Death Metal,4.8,"Got that raw, old school kind of sound to it. Pretty nasty vocals in a way maybe some people like, but it didn't do much for me. I find the riffing pretty bland overall and I feel like that needs to be on point for this style of death metal. ""Mind Under Pressure"" has a cool groove to it"
1/19,Malist,LP,Of Scorched Earth,Melodic Black Metal,4.7,"I like the slow, acoustic passages and the tension they build with them, but the higher energy sections just don't do it for me. Pretty bland riffs and melodies. Forgettable vocals. Whole thing is just meh."
1/19,Lord Dying,LP,Clandestine Transcendence,Sludge Metal,5.5,"Mixed feelings. Didn't care for the clean vocals much, but liked some of the riffage and other songwriting. Theres some healthy ups and downs to the energy which I always appreciate. Probably won't listen again."
1/19,Advocacy,LP,The Path Of Decoherence,Progressive Metal,5.2,Oh my god I can't believe i'm only two songs in. It's really boring and makes time slow down. Extremely mid and uninventive. Sounds *good* and well done but lame song writing.
1/19,External,LP,Dreamscapes,Progressive Metal,8.0,"I like the vibe and instrumentation, but it's a little bland and monotone. It's lacking a certain *spark*. Overall, it's pretty well done and I can't say many negative things. Warrants another listen."
1/19,Kontact,LP,Full Contact,Heavy Metal,3.0,Ohhhhh.... oh nooo.... those vocals are... pain. The musicianship is passable but not spectacular. The songwriting is insanely unimaginative. Back to the vox - it's crazy how bad they are mixed compared to everything else... i'm at a loss for words. EDIT: Holy shit this band formed in 2021....
1/19,Heavy Sentence,EP,Warriors Of Madness,Heavy Metal,3.5,"Bro how do i get two albums in a row with fucked up vocals? The effects on it almost make me dizzy, sounds like it auto-pans front to back at like 10Hz. The bass drum almost cuts out the vocals on every kick... what the hell is going on with the mixing? Vox aside, it's a standard 80s metal album."
1/19,Die Apokalyptischen Reiter,EP,Die Mutter Des Teufels,Heavy Metal,4.4,"German rock, German rock. No notes, very bland, not interesting, lame-o-riffic."
1/19,CobraKill,LP,Serpent's Kiss,Heavy Metal,4.6,"Still desperately clinging to a sound that was popular 40 years ago. It's not bad per se, but man is it dated and bland. The vocals also have a weird synthetic (?) quality to them which is a little grating. Honestly didn't make it throug the whole thing."
1/19,Boundless Chaos,LP,Sinister Upheaval,Death Metal,4.4,"Boy, this is death metal alright...."
1/19,Abhoria,LP,Depths,Black Metal,4.5,Boring black metal. Literally nothing that sticks out to the ear and makes me want to continue listening.
1/19,Almost Dead,LP,Destruction Is All We Know,Death Metal,4.4,"Just some mid ass death metal. Occasional good riff or melody, but largely uninteresting. Feels like a sub-par execution."
1/22,Korvus,EP,Korvus,Progressive Death Metal,5.0,Just some mid progressive death metal. Like... veeeery mid
1/23,The Gems,EP,Fruits of My Labor,Hard Rock,6.3,"Refreshing! Some of the better modern rock I've heard lately. All female group it seems and I dig the vocals. Good melody, good harmony, decent riffing and writing. Won't blow your socks off but it's well executed and pleasant enough."
1/23,The Loot Experiment,EP,Into the Ether,Instrumetal,4.0,"Suuuper bland instrumetal. No real notes, just not very interesting or engaging. Feels like garage session noodling that got recorded. Instrument playing is there, mix quality is ok, songwriting didn't happen."
1/23,Dripping Decay,EP,Ripping Remains,Deathgrind,4.4,I mean it's alright i guess. I will definitely forget I ever listend to this. Last song is best.
1/26,Vitriol,LP,Suffer & Become,Death Metal,6.8,"Thought this would be run-of-the-mill shitty death metal. Instead, this is balls to the wall, complete and utter insanity. It's extremely technical and fast, but not in a tech-deathy sort of way. Feels very true to raw death metal but with absolute madness instrumentation going on. Reminds me of Cattle Decapitation (?) It's probably not my favorite style in the world, but it definitely intrigued and I listened to and enjoyed it all."
1/26,Vipassi,LP,Lightless,Instrumetal,6.2,"Really good musicianship, but I don't feel it's good enough to stand without vocals. In fact, I think having strong vocal lines and lyricism would be a major addition. It's tough out here for instrumental groups - feel like the bar is set SO high with groups like Polyphia and Intervals."
1/26,The Infernal Sea,LP,Hellfenlic,Black Metal,5.8,"Slightly above mid tier black metal. Good vibe building, solid musicianship, but not entirely gripping for me. Won't need to listen again"
1/26,The Gems,LP,Phoenix,Hard Rock,6.3,Good hard rock - basically same review as for their EP preceeding this release
1/26,Dissimulator,LP,Lower Form Resistance,Death Thrash Metal,4.3,Mid trending on bad. They clearly know how to play the instruments well (very technical) but the style and writing is putting me to sleep.
1/26,Junta,LP,Junta,Hardcore,3.9,"Not a fan - I already don't care for this style much but I think their execution is sub par. Really gross tone on the guitar, super formulaic writing, extremely uninteresting. Drums are almost out of time?"
1/26,Abyssius,LP,Abyssius,Technical Death Metal,4.9,"Gnarly stuff - real nast on the vox. Backing music leaves a bit to be desired in terms of writing, execution, and mixing. Definitely feels like a groups first experiment in tech death. Not a bad attempt but lots of room for improvement."
1/26,The Stage of Dreams,LP,The Duality Conflict,,3.0,"Just really bad all around. Bad style, bad execution, bad writing, really no redeeming qualities IMO."
1/26,Statix-X,LP,"Project Regeneration, Vol. 2",Industrial Metal,3.5,"This is just mega not-for-me. I don't really like any part of it, though none of it is, like, bad. I think it's painfully boring and kinda stupid."
1/26,Rituals Of The Dead Hand,LP,The Wretched And The Vile,Blackened Doom Metal,4.2,"Another not-for-me. The first song was 9 minutes long but I felt an eternity pass beneath my feet, cosmic ends met with celestial beginnings, the circular flow of time coil upon itself. Yea kinda uninteresting i guess."
1/26,Olhava,LP,Sacrifice,Atmospheric Black Metal,5.9,"I actually kinda dig their style of atmospheric black metal. Very 'wall-of-sound'. Theres just not much between that and super quiet, droney sections - I think a little more variety would be welcome."
1/26,Nemesis,LP,Embrace Reality,Melodic Death Metal,5.5,"More lame-o melodic death metal. Basically the same stuff I said about Hiraes applies here, but executed worse."
1/26,Mountain Caller,LP,Chronicle II: Hypergenesis,Post Metal,5.1,"It nails its execution of the style - unfortunately I just don't really care for the style. Somewhat sludgey, somewhat post-y, not my cup of tea. Pretty boring if i'm being honest."
1/26,Mega Colossus,LP,Showdown,Heavy Metal,5.6,Very standard heavy metal sound - not really inventive but very well executed.
1/26,Manticora,LP,Mycelium,Progressive Power Metal,5.5,"The core sound is nice - a slightly more intricate and riff oriented version of power metal. The harsh vocals, however, are just plain bad. Like really bad. I appreciate the attempt at adding sonic variety, but damn are they unpleasant. Overall it's pretty unlistenable. Some cool parts that I wish they would expand on, but they just kind of breeze by and go back to the more standard sounds."
1/26,Mago de Oz,LP,Alicia En El Metalverso,Heavy Metal,4.8,"It's fine. Decent melodies on some songs, kidna forgettable overall. Think I could have enjoyed more if I understood the story (it's in Spanish)"
1/26,Madder Mortem,LP,"Old Eyes, New Heart",Avantegarde Metal,4.1,V Lame. V Boring. Didn't enjoy.
1/26,Knoll,LP,As Spoken,Extreme Black Metal,3.1,This album is BANANAS... and not in a good way. Sounds like if Fjkl's first album had talent and a studio behind it. I won't be able to finish this. I don't think its very good.
1/26,Kanseil,LP,Vaia,Folk Metal,5.8,"Not my favorite style, but seems pretty well done. Very standard and doesn't really stray from the folk metal sound"
1/26,Kalt Vindur,LP,Magna Mater,Black Metal,4.3,"As far as black metal goes, it's pretty easy listening. Not a whole lot notable. Executed fine I guess. Not intereseting. Last song is actually good! Only thing that stands out."
1/26,Inquisition,LP,Veneration of Medeival Mysticism and Cosmological Violence,Black Metal,5.9,"Reminds me a lot of old Immortal but with more modern production quality. They're definitely targeting the sound of  OG black metal, which is fine I guess. Not really my thing, but for what it is, it's well executed."
1/26,Hiraes,LP,Dormant,Melodic Death Metal,6.4,"Gives mega 'Dark Tranquility' vibes. Pretty good, not blowing any socks. My major gripe with virtually all melodic death metal these days is it all sounds like they rip off the handful of bands that actually do it well and progress the genre. Nothing new here"
1/26,Exocrine,LP,Legend,Technical Death Metal,6.6,"I really want to like this band, but something about it just isn't quite up my alley. I feel like all the songwriting is just pretty bland. On a technical level, it's extremely well executed and produced. I think the songwriting just doesn't grip me."
1/26,Cognizance,LP,Phantazein,Technical Death Metal,7.3,"Insanely heavy and insanely techincal. Pretty enjoyable - the really don't let off the gas for the whole album. As always, I'd like a little more diversity over the album, but the sound they're delivering is being absolutely nailed."
1/26,Carnal Savagery,LP,Into The Absymal Void,Death Metal,4.4,"This is a guitar tone that I've never really enjoyed much. Overall, this is extremely standard death metal - does not deviate from the formula. Nothing notable."
1/26,Caligula's Horse,LP,Charcoal Grace,Progressive Metal,9.6,"Wow... just wow. What an album. All of my favorite parts of Caligula's Horse condensed and refined into an astounding piece of music. Potential album of the year potential already. This will certainly be in my rotation for months to come. Listen to this right now. (Score likely to change on more listens). UPDATE: God this album is so mfing good. Originally a 9.4, promoting to a 9.6"
1/26,Blood Red Throne,LP,Nonagon,Death Metal,5.0,Pretty standard death metal I thought. Nothing really stuck out
1/26,Any Given Day,LP,Limitless,Djent,4.9,"Not my style. No strong criticisms, just not a style that resonates with me. Its well produced, seems well executed, etc. My only gripe would be songwriting but I'm sure some people love this. I find it a little boring - the melodies aren't earworms for me."
1/27,Albion,LP,Lakesongs of Elbid,Progressive Folk Metal,8.8,"WOW! How have I never heard of this group? It's like if Wilderun turned down the heavy-ness knob by about 3 and in turn turned up the folksy, fantasy knob by as much. The execution is stellar, the songwriting is great. I really have no complaints. Sure, it's a little cheesy at times but I love that shit. Very, very well done. I'm having a hard time rating because it's not a style that I'll binge listen to, but damn it's so well executed."
1/28,Kings Winter,LP,The Other Side Of Fear,Melodic Death Metal,5.0,Weird echo on the vocals that are already kinda mid to begin with. Pretty uninteresting style and execution.
1/31,Silent Stream of Godless Elegy,LP,Jina,Indie Folk,5.1,"Not a style that appeals to me. Execution seems good, but I find it pretty boring. Super chill vibes if you're looking for something like that."
2/2,Wandering Oak,LP,Resilience,Melodic Black Metal,7.1,Kinda goofy vocals... but I actaully like em a lot lol. One of the better melodic black metal albums I've heard lately - very unique sound and style as well as some good changes of pace throughout. Gets a little stale at times but overall pretty decent stuff.
2/2,Utopia,LP,Shame,Technical Death Metal,7.8,"Super cool release that flew completely under my radar until November. I'm still really struggling to get my ears to handle this increasingly-popular style of 'disso-death', but this is probably my favorite version that I've heard so far. At times it's a little too chaotic and unfollowable for me, but I still managed to find some enjoyment in it. By the time you get to the last song 'Moving Gently Towards the Grave' I was so, so ready for those somber chords with the gentle synth in the background. It was an awesome note to leave the album on. I think tech death dudes should check this out. It has the Bassist from Virvum/Vipassi so you know they've got some chops."
2/2,Solbrud,LP,IIII,Atmospheric Black Metal,6.2,"It's good atmospheric black metal, but kinda falls into every pitfall of the genre. Long, windy, meandering vibe sesh's, 17 minute songs for no good reason, kinda fall asleep sometimes listening. It's decent and I do like the style and the vibe, but just gets a little old"
2/2,Persefone,EP,Lingua Ignota: Part I,Progressive Death Metal,7.7,"Good listen - Persefone rarely misses. Feel like the guitar work was a little sub-par, but great vocal melodies and layering, and pretty good song writing. Will definitely listen again."
2/2,Obsidian Tongue,EP,The Stone Heart,Atmospheric Black Metal,4.8,It's fine. Nothing worth nothing - very easy to not pay attention to while listening
2/2,Necrowretch,LP,Swords of Dajjal,Death Metal,4.6,It's death metal. Honestly no comments aside from that I thought it would be more unique in its sound than it ended up being. Something about the album art is extremely offputting to me - like a deep phobia/disturbance type of feeling when i look at it.
2/2,Enterprise Earth,LP,Death: An Anthology,Deathcore,6.7,"Nightmarishly heavy. I like the rhythms, vocals, and general writing style. Guitar tone is a pretty big turn off for me - feels purely percussive with no melodic elements. Not a fault - just a stylistic choice that isn't as appealing to me. I think this is a must listen for deathcore fans. Accelerated Demise is a much needed stylistic change that I really liked. Album seems to employ more range toward the end."
2/2,Dwarrowdelf,LP,The Fallen Leaves,Melodic Black Metal,5.0,"P mid, p mid. Very forgettable. Not bad, not great."
2/2,Deathropy,LP,Deathropy,Melodic Death Metal,5.0,"Idk, mid melo death. Wasn't torture to get through - literally nothing worth noting. Like I finished listening to it 2 minutes ago and I already forgot it."
2/2,Bipolar Architecture,LP,Metaphysicize,Post Metal,6.5,Pretty easy listening to have on in the background. I'd be lying if I said my attention got pulled back to the music more than once or twice. Last song is best. Enjoyable
2/2,Kyros,LP,Mannequin,Progressive Metal,8.8,"WOAH.... that was awesome. Super unique sound and style, love the instrumentation and writing. Will 100% need to listen again - recommend to any prog lovers who like a touch of weirdness in their music"
2/2,Ad Nihilum,EP,An Escape For The Guilty,Melodic Doom Metal,7.4,"Pretty good! Lots of emotion coming through. A bit long in the teeth at some points, but so it goes with this style of music. Good vocals, good range, beautiful backing instruemntals at points."
2/2,Transit Method,LP,Othervoid,Progressive Rock,7.8,"One of the better modern prog rock acts I've heard lately! Lots of variance, pretty easy to listen to, some interesting writing and instrumentation strewn about. Not ground breaking, but a pretty chill piece to vibe to when the mood hits."
2/2,Theraphosa,LP,Inferno,Alternative Progressive Metal,6.9,"Weird style, very unique. Theres a lot of mid filler, but there are some pretty cool sections too. Good riffs, good chorus', good melodies, good concept. It's not exactly a style that suuuper resonates with me, but I'm enjoying the ride. Start to realize the vocals all happen in about 1 octave or so - some variance would be cool."
2/2,Deadyellow,LP,What Was Left Of Them,Post Black Metal,6.7,"Cool vibes, I'm becoming a bit of an atmospheric black metal slut. It's not groundbreaking, but theres good emotional ebbes and flows. If you like the genre, decent listen."
2/6,Nigh Slasher,LP,Nigh Slasher,Thrash Metal,4.8,Boring thrash. Vocals ain't doin it for me either. Feels like slightly thrash-y heavy metal. Not really nailing either style for me
2/9,Torchia,LP,Arcane Magicae,Melodic Death Metal,6.0,"Just kinda mid, bordering on ok melodic death. They have a decent variety of sounds but none of them really hit home for me. Feel like they have potential."
2/9,Spectral Voice,EP,Sparagmos,Folk Metal,7.2,Cool mfing vibes. Kinda thing you can just sit back and chill to. Cool throat singing
2/9,Romuvos,LP,Spirits,Folk Metal,6.9,"Good vibes - really good execution of the drone-y, viking-y, pagan-y folk metal. The kind of thing you can just sit back and chill to. It won't distract too much while working. It's not breathtaking music, but I appreciate it's style and energy (when the mood is right)."
2/9,Petrification,LP,Sever Sacred Light,Death Metal,5.1,"Dope album art, Pretty standard death metal."
2/9,Morbid Saint,LP,Swallowed By Hell,Thrash Metal,4.7,Mid as all hell
2/9,Infected Rain,LP,Time,Nu Metal,3.9,"Damn, I REALLY didn't like this. I hate almost everything about the style. If I'm being objective, it's well performed and executed - it is just the furthest thing in the world from being my cup of tea."
2/9,Hulder,LP,Verses In Oath,Black Metal,4.1,"Oh man, they recorded the vocals in a shower stall... and the dungeon synth in the background hoo wee. It just aint doin it for me. I don't really dig any part of it - don't think I'll be able to finish."
2/9,Hannes Grossmann,EP,Echoes Of Eternity,Progressive Death Metal,6.5,"Kinda dissapointed as Hannes Grossman usually doesn't miss. And this EP isn't a miss, just felt a little cookie-cutter to me. No major standout tracks IMO. Will listen again tho and update."
2/9,F.K.U.,LP,The Horror And The Metal,Thrash Metal,5.1,"Yep, heavy metal with a hint of thrash. Dated style, nothing new, close the yearbook fellas. I'm bored. Execution is good i guess. I don't care"
2/9,EXA,LP,Left In Shards,Thrash Metal,5.4,Decently mid thrash. Sounds like what Power Trip would sound like if the were worse lol. Not that interesting but not suffering.
2/9,Chelsea Wolfe,LP,She Reaches Out To She Reaches Out To She,Industrial/Gothic/Neofolk,6.8,"A bizarre piece of art (in a pretty good way). Produces a very haunting, trancing vibe. Not the easiest thing in the world to listen to, but this is made with love, passion, and exploration. Enjoyable listen, but probably not for everyone."
2/9,Chapel Of Disease,LP,Echoes Of Light,Progressive Metal,6.9,"Felt weaker than their previous release. Similar style, but none of it as memorable. Riffs aren't as strong, melodies aren't as memorable, guitar work just isn't as dominant. I enjoyed it, but I kind of forgot it."
2/15,Stellar Remains,LP,Wastelands,Progressive Thrash Metal,7.4,"First two songs do not do this album justice. As you get further in you hear different styles and tones and it gets pretty refreshing. Their standard speed/thrash sound is somewhat bland, but the more intricate, soft parts are cool. Harsh (barely) vocals are the weakest part. Good instrumentation"
2/15,Illumishade,LP,Another Side Of You,Progressive Metalcore,6.5,"Not too shabby. The sound gets a little stale for me at times but there are a few tracks strewn about that break it up. Its a weird style - almost like metalcore-y instrumentation but somehow a somewhat power metal sound. Female vox, if you specifically like that sort of thing. Not unpleasant listen whatsoever, but i'm not clammering for more."
2/16,The Aristocrats,LP,Duck,Progressive Metal,7.3,"Really fun, jazzy instrumetal album! This is one of those styles that I personally struggle to sit through a whole album of, but this is super fun, lighthearted, engaging album. All of the instrumentation is amazing - really everyone is playing incredibly. I think it really has everything that goofy prog nerds love - awesome bass lines, the time signature is really just a 'suggestion', and awesome shreddy playing over jazzy progressions. Stylistically it just isn't my favorite thing ever, but you can't deny the execution and vibe. Really fun and I think prog dudes will enjoy."
2/16,Syncatto,LP,Fiction,Math Rock,8.5,"Amazing, one of the best math instrumetal albums I've heard in a while. Super fresh, insane technicality, intricate rhythms, catching melodies, not a complaint in the world. Great album - only 8.5 because math metal doesn't evoke much emotion for me."
2/16,Vanir,LP,Epitome,Viking Metal,5.9,Just some very predictable viking metal - nothing to see here
2/16,Throne Of Thorns,LP,Converging Parallel Worlds,Progressive Power Metal,4.9,"Psuedo-prog, not inventive, not interesting, well performed."
2/16,The Obsessed,LP,Gilded Sorrow,Heavy Metal,4.3,"Just some mid-ass, mediocre heavy metal. Extremely repetitive riffing and vox"
2/16,Sujin,LP,Save Our Souls,Melodic Death Metal,6.8,"Better-than-avergae melo-death. It's no Insomnium, but the music is actually interesting and feels more inspired than most melodeath these days. Good vocals and variance. Good instrumentation and rhythms."
2/16,Praise the Plague,LP,Suffocating In The Current Of Time,Atmospheric Black Metal,4.3,"Mid atmos black. Doesn't really build much atmosphere to me, just kinda slow and plodding and black. Not my favorite"
2/16,Pestilength,LP,Solar Clorex,Death Doom Metal,4.1,Not a fan. Lame gurgle vox with lame music underneath. Just doesn't do it for me in any way. I can't even tell if it's being done well.
2/16,Ihsahn,LP,Ihsahn,Extreme Progressive Metal,8.2,"Damn, Ihsahn just don't miss. Really strong release - great vocal harmonies, great melodies, good heavy passages, just like the perfect extreme prog style. His harsh vox has never been my *favorite* but its not bad by any means."
2/16,Farsot,LP,Life Promised Death,Progressive Black Metal,5.2,"Meh, not suffering to listen but not really doing anythin for me. It's black metal with a little spice of experimentation on it."
2/16,Far Beyond,LP,The End Of My Road,Progressive Viking Metal,7.9,"A fresh(er) take on a style that usually doesn't do much for me. I think the vocals really shine here - great harmonies and his voice one is unique. Good riffing and backing instrumentals in general. It's still not my favorite style ever, but I truly enjoyed the whole thing."
2/16,Eternal Storm,LP,A Giant Bound to Fall,Progressive Doom Metal,7.4,"Immaculate vibes. Haunting, plodding, dreary, depressing. Really well done stuff - not the kind of thing you can listen to at any time, but when the vibe is present, this is perfect."
2/16,Darkspace,EP,Dark Space - II,Post Metal,3.9,"Respectfully, if I've invested 10 minutes listening to your single, 47 minute track, i need something to actually happen. I'm bored, you're boring me, this is boring. Maybe something cool finally happens later but I guess I'll never know. It's not a miserable listen so far but literally nothing has happened. No developement, no progression, same sound over and over again."
2/16,Sun of Nothing,EP,Maze,Post Punk,2.0,Do i have to? If i absolutely had to say something nice about it.... the headache i got from listening made me forget about how tired I felt. I actually feel like I'm trancing out and dissociating...
2/16,"Pretty decent overall, but not a style I'm super in to. The clean vox style here reeaally irritates me - reminds me a lot of mid 2000s emo cleans and I just can't do it. The rest of it is pretty good, albeit a little stale. The album is pretty emotionally charged (in a good way) and I can tell theres a high amount of 'self' and passion put into it, I think the style is just a barrier for me. Very, very well executed I think.",LP,Maybe In Another Life,Metalcore,6.3,"Pretty decent overall, but not a style I'm super in to. The clean vox style here reeaally irritates me - reminds me a lot of mid 2000s emo cleans and I just can't do it. The rest of it is pretty good, albeit a little stale. The album is pretty emotionally charged (in a good way) and I can tell theres a high amount of 'self' and passion put into it, I think the style is just a barrier for me. Very, very well executed I think.'"
2/16,Griffon,LP,De Republica,Progressive Black Metal,8.0,"Really enjoyable! Will definitely need to listen again. Lots of ups and downs, decent vox, good melodies and instrumentation."
2/16,In Autumn,LP,What's Done Is Done,Melodic Death Metal,5.6,"Big snooze - legit got very bored listening. There are some pretty passages strewn throughout, but the core sound just isn't doing it for me. Not a big fan of the baritone clean vocals here either, which is usually something I like. Track 6 ""Breathing In The Void"" is best song IMO - slow, beautiful, ominous, decent."
2/16,Kalah,LP,And yet It Dreams,Progressive Power Metal,5.2,Felt like really uninspired prog-power metal. I know theres a story underneath but I couldn't pick up on all of it. Just a mid tear lil thang here
2/16,Daniel Popel,LP,A New Experience,Progressive Metal,6.0,"Bro... what an album. Seems like the kid is about 17 and just getting started putting music out. As far as I can tell, he performed, recorded, mixed, and mastered the entire thing himself (heavily utilizing sound libraries, of course). It's pretty rough around the edges (especially the vocals), but honestly... it's not half bad. Super creative, TONS of styles attempted throughout, some straight up funny covers... if you can get past the scuffed recording I think prog nerds will like this lmao."
2/17,Bonestorm,LP,Under The Sight Of Time,Death Metal,4.9,Middest death metal possible. I remember at least one cool little breakdown-y thing so that was good.
2/23,Morta Skuld,LP,Creation Undone,Death Metal,4.0,Mid bordering bad death metal. Really do not enjoy the vocals. No interesting musicianship underneath IMO - just a cookie cutter death metal album where everything is slightly worse than average.
2/23,Job For A Cowboy,LP,Moon Healer,Technical Death Metal,6.5,"I'm really not understanding the hype on this one. It's good, like it's extremely well executed, but there is not a single ear worm for me in the entire album. It just kind of runs and then it's over. Not a *ton* of sonic variance, but theres a little. Not sure, listened to it twice and still came away not appreciating it all that much."
2/23,Hand Of Kalliach,LP,Corryvreckan,Melodic Death Metal,7.2,I liked the style. Good vocals both clean and harsh. Well produced. Sound had a unique quality that I appreciate.
2/23,Fragment Soul,EP,Galois Paradox,Progressive Gothic Metal,8.4,"LOVE the style and the vibe. Very unique and evocative. I was in the perfect mood for this which really made it hit - definitely listen when its dark, gray, and rainy out. Great pacing and variance - really well done."
2/23,Dust Bolt,LP,Sound & Fury,Crossover Thrash Metal,8.3,Dust Bolt is just the uncontested king of crossover thrash. I love their riffing so so much. Definitely give this a listen if you're into thrash or punk-y sound. Good variety keeps it interesting from start to end.
2/23,Darkest Hour,LP,Perpetual / Terminal,Melodic Metalcore,7.4,"It's fine melodic metalcore. Not really a style that I vibe with very well, but I'm trying not to hold that against them. It's a very easy listen and does a lot of things right. Good, albeit formulaic song structures, great execution, good song-to-song variety, really not a lot to complain about if you like the style. I think a lot of people would probably dig this a lot - maybe FFO August Burns Red or Trivium? "
2/23,Borknagar,LP,Fall,Progressive Black Metal,8.2,"Great album. Tons of sonic variety, emotional ebbes & flows, good instrumentation/vocals. It's extremely well executed and they have a unique sound. Very fresh listen and thoroughly enjoyed from start to finish. Not all of it is super memorable, but all very pleasant with memorable moments strewn about."
2/23,Austrian Death Machine,EP,Quad Brutal,Metalcore,6.4,Pretty good for being a tongue-and-cheek tribute to Arnold Schwarzenegger. Good intstrumentation and guest vocalists
2/23,Atoll,LP,Inhuman Implants,Brutal Death Metal,4.5,"Jesus fucking christ. Not my cup of tea. Way too much. I'm assuming this is well done for the genre, so i'll toss it a point or two. Another .5 for the always sunny sample"
2/23,Amaranthe,LP,The Catalyst,Alternative Metal,,
2/23,Sleepytime Gorilla Museum,LP,of the Last Human Being,Progressive Metal,3.0,"Holy shit... I fucking hate this.... wow. SALAMANDA... dude wtf dude nobody wants to hear you yell about salamanders and their multiple worlds. I like weird music, but this outflanked me severely. Closest thing I can think of is Diablo Swing Orchestra... but worse... idk I hate all of it. Do not listen to this unless you have a completely shattered taste in music. Lev music, iykyk."
2/23,Lost in Lavendar Town,EP,On Tonight's Show,Progressive Metal,,
2/23,Bleak Sanctuary,LP,The Dark Night of the Soul,Progressive Death Metal,4.9,"Extremely bland. I'm not even sure I'd really call this progressive music. It was an uphill battle for this album because I was malding out of my mind over a reddit post while listening. Still don't think I would have enjoyed much under better circumstances. It's well executed - decent instrumentation and vocals, but the writing is plain boring."
2/23,Defying,LP,Wadera,Progressive Metal,,
2/23,Cyphre,LP,Idolatry,Progressive Death Metal,5.9,"Ok-ish prog death. The riffing is kinda mid and the vocals are like 6/10, but there are some nice clean sections (instrumental). Pretty bland overall but not the worst thing ever."
2/23,Nebularis,LP,"Exodus: Shattered Earth Saga, Pt. 1",Progressive Metal,5.8,"I'd call this more standard heavy metal with a slight progresive bend. It's not bad - not exactly thrilling, but it's a super quick listen that kept me more or less engaged. You can skip and not really miss anything."
2/23,The Bitter Season,LP,Embrace of the Sea,Progressive Metalcore,5.4,"Didn't really do anything for me stylistically. Felt like pretty standard, bland metalcore but with a veneer of progressivism in the form of occasional synth strings."
2/23,Chainsword,LP,BORN TRIUMPHANT,Death Metal,5.2,"It's death metal. Riffs pretty uninteresting, vocals are ok bordering on decent. Not really my cup of tea but not bad, per se. A mega death metal fan will probably vibe with it."
2/29,Theatrum,LP,Tableau Vivant,Progressive Metal,6.4,"Pretty interesting group. I can tell they have a fair amount of potential, but they need to figure out how to make the singer's vocals sit better in the mix, as well as her melodies meld better with the underlying music. There are some cool, experimental moments that caught my ear, but they are surrounded with a lot of uninspired passages that get a bit tedious to wade through. I think if they iron out their song writing and style goals as well as find a better mixer/masterer, they could be a powerful addition to the scene."
2/29,Mean Messiah,LP,In Infinite Illusion,Industrial Death Metal,,
2/29,Immortal Souls,EP,Cold Sounds,Melodic Death Metal,3.9,"Mid music, just plain bad vocals. Like, I really don't like the vocals. I would skip this one, hell I don't see myself finishing it."
3/1,Big Big Train,LP,The Likes of Us,Progressive Metal,8.9,"I can't believe I missed this release by over 6 months - discovered in October! What an absolutely bonkers album. It sounds like they may have gotten a new vocalist, (google confirmed, previous vox passed away in 2022 :(   ) but he is carrying the torch extremely well. From what I gather, he is also playing guitar and keys - definitely bringing a new spin to their sound which I'm totally vibing with. There are so many different energies delivered - from chaotic non-diatonic, heavy riffing to sweet, soft, lullaby melodies. An EXTREMELY strong prog release in my opinion - I can't think of a weak point. The only thing that separates this from, say Charcoal Grace, is just the emotional depth of the lyrics. I've only listened once so maybe theres a lot more going on than I'm giving credit for - will come back and update if it starts to really move me on subsequent listens. PROGHEADS MUST LISTEN."
3/1,Volcandra,LP,The Way Of Ancients,Melodic Black Metal,6.5,"Pretty decent. Good riffing, good vox, good guitar work. Honestly no major complaints or criticism, it just kind of *is*"
3/1,Suldusk,LP,Anthesis,,,
3/1,Suicidal Angels,LP,Profane Prayer,Thrash Metal,,
3/1,Shallow Waters,LP,All Colours Blur To One,Melodic Death Metal,6.8,"I like the clean baritone vox. Overally, it's a better than average, but not stunning melo-death release. I'd say it's worth a listen if you're into the style. Theres some good passages that brought me back in when i started to lose interest."
3/1,Sentry,LP,Sentry,Heavy Metal,,
3/1,Profane Burial,LP,My Plateau,Symphonic Black Metal,,
3/1,Pestilential Shadows,LP,Devil's Hammer,Black Metal,,
3/1,Northern Genocide,LP,The Point Of No Return,Melodic Black Metal,,
3/1,Ministry,LP,HOPIUMFORTHEMASSES,Industrial Metal,4.1,God I hate Ministry. It's so on-the-nose that it's stripped of all artistry. The music is... fine - well produced i guess - but uninteresting.
3/1,Messiah,LP,Christus Hypercubus,Death Thrash Metal,4.8,Really boring. I think the lyricism is kinda dumb. Not the worst listen but will never listen again.
3/1,Kiuas,EP,Samooja: Pyhiinvaellus,Power Metal,,
3/1,InnerSphere,LP,In The Shadows Of The Sun,Melodic Death Metal,5.2,"Really boring. Idk man i think I just can't do melo-death much anymore. It's always SO formulaic and alld ends up sounding the same. Only a select few bands ever pull it off well in my opinion. It's not bad, it just doesn't make me feel anything whatsoever."
3/1,Hands Of Goro,LP,Hands Of Goro,Heavy Metal,4.9,"Yep, heavy metal alright. Bland, boring, dated, uninspired. Slightly sub-par production, execution is fine. Bad album art."
3/1,Fathomless Ritual,LP,Hymns For The Lesser Gods,Technical Death Metal,3.2,"Oh fuck dude I just cannot do these vocals. I think they are truly terrible and I cannot fathom it being some artistic choice. The music underneath has potential, but it is utterly overshadowed by the god awful gurgle vocals. I'm actually getting angry just listening to this. I'm not sure i've ever experienced vocals just fucking tanking an album like this."
3/1,Einvigi,LP,Monokroma,Shoegaze,6.5,"Nice, easy, enjoyable listen. No major notes, its worth a listen if you like shoegaze-y stuff."
3/1,Devastator,LP,Conjurers of Cruelty,Blackened Thrash Metal,5.5,Pretty ok blackened thrash. Not really my vibe but it seems pretty well done. Good instrumentation and production. Riffs are forgettable but that's most of thrash these das
3/1,Celestial Sword,LP,Nocturnal Divinity,Dungeon Synth,2.9,"Not good - noisy, loud, incomprehensible, uninteresting. Don't even like the vibe/atmosphere they're going for. Cool album art tho"
3/4,Universe Effects,EP,The Distance,Progressive Rock,7.8,"Really fun prog rock listen. I love the instrumentation and songwriting - the keys especially give me some dream theater vibes. Vocals are a little lackluster IMO and never really drive the song much, but its definitely worth a listen for prog fans. Its a quick 30 minute adventure."
3/4,Observers,LP,The Age of the Machine Entities,Melodic Metal,7.0,"Pretty interesting instrumental album - it's pretty distinct from the typical proggy instrumetal you hear these days. Very melodic, very vibe-building, very fun listen. Not sure I would want to listen to it more than every few months or so, but a solid album and exection nonetheless. Worth a listen if you need something on in the background at work."
3/5,Motherwood,LP,A Fading Energy,Atmospheric Black Metal,5.4,Painfully boring. Really not my style of atmos black - felt heavily lacking in true atmosphere. Maybe just wasn't in the mood for it today.
3/6,Molten,LP,Malicide,Death Metal,6.2,"Decent, thrash, death metal. Nothing really to report - not remotely groundbreaking or invent, but it achieves it's stylistic goals and executes on them quite well. Better than I expected, but I expected garbage."
3/7,Municipal Waste,EP,Tango & Thrash,Crossover Thrash Metal,,
3/7,Inner Missing,LP,The Diary,Gothic Metal,5.9,"Super boring, but I'm not into this style. Just feels like nothing happens in any song, just sits on a sound for 7 minutes and does that 6 times. Vocals are decent I guess. Piano vibe is good."
3/8,Wade Black's Astronomica,LP,The Awakening,Heavy Metal,,
3/8,The End Machine,LP,The Quantum Phase,Heavy Metal,,
3/8,Sonata Arctica,LP,Clear Cold Beyond,Power Metal,5.1,"Very boring, bland power metal. Not a fan but maybe power-nerds like this. Album art looks oddly 40 years old."
3/8,Slimelord,LP,Chytridiomycosis Relinquished,Death Doom Metal,6.5,"Cool-ish sludgey death metal. Not winning any awards, but it was an easy and unique listen"
3/8,Skeletal Remains,LP,Fragments of the Ageless,Death Metal,5.2,It's death metal.
3/8,Pantheist,EP,Kings Must Die,Funeral Doom Metal,4.9,"I really just don't enjoy the funeral doom style. God this was boring to me. Theres some cool parts that caught my ear so I know it's at least somewhat well executed, but man the style is just a slog to get through for me."
3/8,Myrath,LP,Karma,Progressive Metal,,
3/8,Mokoma,LP,Myrsky,Heavy Metal,4.2,"Didn't enjoy. Don't like the cleans, the harsher vox are mid, the music is mediocre."

3/8,Before The Dawn,EP,Archaic Flame,Melodic Death Metal,,
3/8,Merrimack,LP,Of Grace and Gravity,Black Metal,5.9,"Not really my cup of tea. The song writing is very bland to me, theres a lot of sound but not a lot for your ear to really grab ahold of. Pretty monotone throughout the whole thing - not a lot of ups and downs musically. Its not bad, but I won't listen again."
3/8,Apogean,LP,Cyberstrictive,Technical Death Metal,8.2,"Pretty sick tech death - a good follow up to their awesome EP. Definitely will need to relisten as theres a lot going on. The riffing is good, the performance is extremely tight, and the vocals rip. Great release for the the tech death fans."
3/8,Discernment,LP,To Leave,Progressive Metal,,"The instrumentation is very well done and the songwriting is dynamic and interesting. My only complaint is the clean (slightly distorted) vocals just aren't strong IMO. The female cleans and growls are pretty decent. The whole thing is very nicely laid out and executed so I really can't complain toooo much. Just not super resonating with me, I guess."
3/8,Turbulence,LP,Binary Dream,Progressive Metal,,
3/8,Exhorder,LP,Defect Omnium,Thrash Metal,,

3/8,Beyond The Hate,LP,Darkest Times,Melodic Death Metal,,
3/8,Moonoises,LP,She - The Void,Post Metal,3.8,No. No no no. God I struggle with post metal - why they gotta make it sound so shitty all the time.
3/8,Hydra,EP,Into The Void,Progressive Metal,,
3/8,Skull Incision,EP,Grim,Death Metal,4.8,"Very forgettable. Nasty vocals stand out, but the music doesn't do anything for me. It's just a sludgey-ish death metal EP. Execution is OK i guess."
3/8,TKTWA,LP,Eukaryotic,Post Metal,6.1,"Not bad, not great, not my favorite style ever but still seems well done. The typical vocals of post metal have just never really done it for me. The song structure is pretty good and theres decent variance of style across the album. It really just isn't my favorite sound in the world I think."
3/8,Vicinity,LP,VIII,Progressive Metal,8.0,"Super enjoyable listen - sounds like Seventh Wonder without the soaring vocals. The execution is *extremely* on point - really not techhnical misses. The writing is a little weak at times and the vocals are all basically within one octave, but they are delivering the best sound that I believe the group is capable of."
3/8,Solvapor,LP,Inner Soul,Progressive Metal,7.1,"I really appreciated the style and tone at first, then it didn't really change for most of the album. It really is a well done progressive metalcore-y release, just not blowing me away or anything. Does a lot of the tropes of the genre, but its mixed in with a fair amount of originality. I'm conflicted on how I feel about it - gonna chalk it up to being a good release that just wasn't quite my style preference."
3/8,Lou Kelly,LP,Never Was,Avante-garde Metal,6.8,"This is some really out there shit. Loved Lou Kelly on Zon by The World is Quiet Here, and his vocals are definitely the standout component of the performance here. The whole thing is just balls to the wall weirdness from start to finish and I'm definitely here for it. It isn't really my favorite thing ever, but I respect the hell out of the creativity and execution. He's a wildly talented vocalist for how underground he is. He makes some weird squek sounds I've never heard anyone else make before. I probably won't listen to this again for a long time."
3/8,Nick Johnston,LP,Child Of Bliss,Instrumetal,7.8,"Super easy, fun listen. Never a dull moment and Johnston always manages to keep you on your toes. Its not lifechanging or anything, but a good solid release"
3/10,Shadowpath,LP,The Aeon Discordance,Symphonic Progressive Metal,,
3/10,Daemoniac,LP,Visions Of The Nightside,Death Metal,4.8,Just a very bland death metal release. They've got that one guitar tone that just absolutely drives me up a wall. I'd skip tbh. Better death releases this year.
3/14,Defect Designer,LP,Chitin,Death Metal,5.6,"Kinda disappointing - was originally pitched to me as progressive death metal, and I guess by some standards it might be, but feels a lot closer to standard death metal to me. It's not bad, has some cool-ish non-standard stylistic choices and writing schemes, but overall the sound just doesn't do it for me. Not a fan of the guitar tone nor the vox. Production overall just isn't my favorite. I think I'd probably advise a skip on this one."
3/15,Whom Gods Destroy,LP,Insanium,Progressive Metal,6.7,"Lots of praiseworthy things going on here - grand sweeping melodies and arrangements, intricate guitar and synth work, overall pretty well done prog. My only complaint is the vocals, and that it's sort of played ""straight down the fairway"". Didn't feel all that inventive or have much of a unique voice. It was good for what it was and I think prog nerds can enjoy it for a listen or two, but it likely won't be something you keep coming back to. Well executed overall."

3/15,Necrophobic,LP,In The Twilight Grey,Melodic Black Metal,6.5,"I think a lot of people really like these guys, but it didn't really do much for me. Production was really high and the talent is clearly there, the writing and style just didn't do much of anything for me. I like this style more when it's broken up with cleaner melodic passages. The straight melo-black for 40+ minutes just gets old to my ear."

3/15,Lutharo,LP,Chasing Euphoria,Melodic Death Metal,,
3/15,Lucifer Was,LP,En Fix Ferdig Mann,Progressive Rock,5.1,"Goofy german prog rock. I respect the grind, but a little too goofy and german for my taste. No shortage of experimentation, instruments, and weirdness. Doesn't really do it for me."
3/15,Eternal Autumn,LP,Below The Lightless Heavens,Melodic Death Metal,,
3/15,Eternal,LP,Cryptic Lust,Death Metal,4.7,"Mid riffing, mid vox, mid tone, mid writing. Skip"
3/15,DragonForce,LP,Warp Speed Warriors,Power Metal,,
3/15,Aborted,LP,Vaulf Of Horrors,Death Metal,8.4,"Daaaamn what a sound. Such an over-the-top, balls to the wall, shit-smearingly loud album. This is a type of death metal I can fuck with. It checks off all of the typical death metal boxes but also manages to have a unique sound and keep me interested - reminds me of Vitriol's release earlier this year. Good release."
3/22,Acathexis,EP,Immerse,Melodic Black Metal,4.5,Really mfing noisy for not much going on. Theres a few sections with emotive chords but overall it all sounds very similar and not that interesting. Not my type of melodic black metal.
3/22,Alestorm,EP,Voyage Of The Dead Marauders,Power Metal,6.8,"I mean its alestorm. Its a fun little EP but nothing earthshattering. The folk/power genre just aint really my vibe most of the time. They do it well, for what it is."
3/22,Critical Defiance,LP,The Search Won't Fall,Thrash Metal,4.7,"Very mid thrash. Best part is the psychic pebbles scream about 1 minute into Full Paranoia. Its just bland, forgettable thrash."
3/22,Deception,LP,Daenacteh,Melodic Death Metal,,
3/22,Hideous Divinity,LP,Unextinct,Technical Death Metal,6.9,"I'm one track in and I'm shitting myself hearing such ferocity. As it went on, I started to lose interest. There really wasn't much there for me to latch on to musically - no banger riffs, no banger melodic sections, really nothing besides abject violence. And hey, if thats what you want out of your tech death then this will be your shit. For what it is, it is clearly executed at the highest level and is nailing its goal. Personally, its just not a stylistic decision that I vibe with."
3/22,Apparition,LP,Disgraced Emanations From A Tranquil State,Death Metal,4.8,Its more death metal.
3/22,Hamfero,LP,Men Gu​ð​s Hond Er Sterk,Doom Metal,7.6,Pretty good listen! I like their style of doom metal - its a genre I typically have trouble vibing with. Good emotional swells and ebbes/flows to the music. It feels a little stagnant at times but thats kinda what you get with doom
3/22,Fall Of Serenity,LP,"Open Wide, O Hell",Death Metal,6.0,"Decent-ish melodic death metal - I liked the first song and it just felt a little more uninspired as it went. Pretty monotonous throughout, nothing spectacular and could probably skip."
3/22,Sveroth,LP,By the Way of Light,Atmospheric Black Metal,6.2,Pretty ok atmos black. Nothing amazing but a chill listen - helps that I tend to vibe with the genre.
3/22,Bodyfarm,LP,Malicious Ecstasy,Death Metal,4.4,It's whatever death. So much mid death these days.
3/22,Aberration,LP,Refraction,Death Metal,4.1,"I'd really rather not. So noisy, so loud, so little going on to attach your ear to."
3/22,Artificial Language,EP,Distant Glow,Progressive Metal,8.4,"I've grown to really love these guys, especially Charlie Robbins' guiar work. It's always just a fun listen with a ton going on. Hard recommend for prog-heads."

3/29,Coffins,LP,Sinister Oath,Death Metal,,
3/29,The Absence,LP,The Absence,Melodic Death Metal,4.9,"Mid melodeath (as usual). I must just not really dig the subgenre as much as I thought because it is all so overwhelmingly mid to me. Its fine, decently executed, bland writing, forgettable melodies/riffs. Not my favorite vocals."
3/29,Carrion Vael,LP,Cannibals Anynoymous,Technical Death Metal,7.4,"Sick riffs, damn. Guitar work in general is *very* well done. Decent vocals, drumming kinda just sits in the background. Good clean sections that keep it interesting. Something about it just lacks that *oomph* however. Gets a little stale and starts to all sound very similar after a while, but it does sound pretty good from start to finish."
3/29,Kolga,LP,Black Tides,Blackened Surf Rock,6.6,"Really fun/funny listen. It definitely lives up to the surf rock vibe. Certainly not my favorite style ever, but it was an enjoyable, off-kilter listen to break up the monotony of 83 consecutive hyper-serious melodic death metal albums."
3/29,Words Of Farewell,EP,Stories to Forget,Melodic Death Metal,6.8,A better stab at melodeath than I've heard recently (not saying much). Theres some good variance across the EP but a lot of it doesn't really land for me. Last song has a cool intro and riffing. Vocals are pretty standard. Overall its well executed but its a genre that I'm falling out of love with.
3/29,Black Bomb A,LP,Unbuild The World,Metalcore,3.8,The song song legit has Southpark's Cartman on vox - wtf. Not my thing. Oh.... it's all like that.... god have mercy.
3/29,Boundaries,LP,Death Is Little More,Metalcore,4.9,"Not really my vibe. The vocals and lyrics are pretty nasty, but the underlying instrumentation, song structure, and writing just doesn't do it for me."
3/29,Ulterror,LP,Transcendent Origins,Technical Death Metal,5.2,"Unfortunately pretty mid tech death. Not a lot going on musically that really catches my ear. Vocals are decent but not incredible. The guitar work itself is clean and well executed, the writing just leaves a bit to be desired."
3/29,Malphas,LP,Portal,Melodic Death Metal,5.8,"Mid melo-death. Had some pretty strong undertones of 'fuck da gubberment'. Idk just never gripped me at all. Well produced and executed, good instrumentation, just not my style and got bored."
3/29,Shadow Limb,LP,Reclaim,Progressive Sludge Metal,6.7,Not too shabby. Not a headturner or anything but it was a chill listen to vibe out to on a Tuesday morning. It fits pretty squarely into what I expect when I think of progressive sludge.
4/5,Ingested,LP,The Tide of Death and Fractured Dreams,Death Metal,7.6,"Pretty decent death metal release - checks off a lot of the boxes that I like to hear in death. Has some clean sections with ominous guitars behind as well as comprehensible lyrics during the nasty vox sections. Whole album remains pretty interesting from start to finish. Stylistically it probably can't get higher than an 8 or so from me, but the execution is as high as you could hope. Last song is NASTY."

4/5,Witch Vomit,LP,Funeral Sanctum,Death Metal,,
4/5,Belore,LP,Eastern Tales,Atmospheric Black Metal,,
4/5,Hour of Penance,LP,Devotion,Technical Death Metal,7.4,"I saw a lot of buzz about this album and I can see why. Suuuper technical, extremely fast, mega heavy, definitely a solid tech death release. Personally, it didn't really hit exactly what I look for in the genre, but I think most tech death fellas should definitely check this out. I thought it needed a little more song-to-song variation - a 'ballad' or something thrown around to change up the pace and keep it engaging. The execution is flawless - the mix is very well done and I feel like I can make out all of the instruments (maybe bass is a little quiet?) Check it out."
4/5,Orecus,LP,Dreadnought,Melodic Death Metal,,
4/5,Horndal,LP,Head Hammer Man,Post Metal,6.8,"Not bad - got kind of a crossover thrash type of feeling mixed with a more prominent post metal sound. Enjoyable but won't listen again. Good production and execution, just not my style."
4/5,Bilwis,LP,Hameln,Atmospheric Black Metal,6.0,"Pretty average atmospheric black metal, kinda light on the atmospheric vibe. There were a few standout passages that definitely caught my ear, but largely it was pretty forgettable. Well produced, well executed, just somewhat bland writing in my opinion."
4/5,ERRA,LP,CURE,Metalcore,6.9,"Pretty refreshing style of metalcore for me. I like the heavier use of cleans but still leveraging the harsh when it feels right. This style for me still generally sounds a little overproduces and sanitized, and it didn't have any major ear-worms for me that I was eager to hear again. Enjoyable listen but I probably won't ever do it again."
4/5,Protosequence,LP,Bestiary,Technical Death Metal,6.3,"Not my favorite style of the genre. Not bad, just a little too hectic without much form or ear-grabbing riffs/melodies. Pretty nasty (in a good way) but not may favorite."
4/5,Burn Down Eden,EP,Dismal,Melodic Death Metal,6.2,"Pretty quick easy listen that kept me mostly engaged. Got a little stale but there were some good riffs pretty evenly throughout. Not enough to want to listen again, but it was aight."
4/5,Filth,LP,Southern Hostility,Deathcore,4.8,"I'm really not a fan of this. Guitar tone is good, riffing is pretty bland (very deathcore-y, super rhythmic), decent rhythms... a *very* cringe rap section in the second song. The entire thing is very ""slam"" energy, ""don't fuck with me mother fucker I'll fuck you up you supid mother fucker"". Boring breakdowns, similar songs for a lot of the album, that is unless theyre broken up by rap metal. Allegedly deathcore dudes are a fan, but I think literally anyone else should just pass."
4/6,Labyrinthus Stellarum,LP,Vortex of the Worlds,Atmospheric Black Metal,7.8,"Really cool release, one of the better melds of atmos black and dungeon synth that I've ever heard. Will definitely listen again just for the vibes."
4/8,Oceans Of Night,LP,Mindstorm,Progressive Metal,5.4,"So dissapointed, the first song is some pretty cool, chill prog instrumental. Then they migrate to pseudo-prog style thats really common, and really overdone these days. Its still not bad - its on the higher end side of pseudo-prog but it just does not grip me at all. Not a fan of the male vox but the female vocals sound better (despite the recording quality sounding worse for some reason?) and the lyrics are lack-luster. Ok all the guest vocalists are recorded on a potato..."
4/11,Battlecreek,LP,Maze of the Mind,Thrash Metal,5.5,"Mid to decent thrash. Not my favorite vocal style - its a shame because theres some pretty good harsh vocals thrown around that don't get utilized much. Pretty standard, nothing too special, not unpleasant listen."
4/11,Veriteras,LP,The Dark Horizon,Melodic Death Metal,,
4/12,Replicant,LP,Infinite Mortality,Death Metal,6.4,"If you love raw, nasty death metal, this is an album for you. I like the riffing and guitar work, but the writing just isn't so much my style. I think its a good representation of where the genre is at these days, and it sounds pretty well executed. Won't listen again but I appreciated it."
4/12,Tyr,LP,Battle Ballads,Folk Metal,7.0,"Very well done, just not my favorite style. My issue with this genre is they always have plentiful, decent melodies, however the melodies feel very superficial. They're never earworms that make me NEED to hear the melody again. Idk, its an extremely well done representation of the power/folk metal genre, but it feels a little hollow to me."
4/12,Necrot,LP,Lifeless Birth,Death Metal,5.4,"Yet more *** death metal ***. Its death metal. Decent riffing, but not much else to speak of. Its exactly what you expect from a death metal album. Did I mention this is death metal?"
4/12,Ekbom,LP,Benighted,Technical Death Metal,7.8,"This is some absolutely batshit crazy, off the walls tech death. Up there with Infant Annihilator in terms of intensity, but channeled in a way that is a little more accessible to me. Insanely fast, decent riffing, nasty vocals, it really has it all. Excellent listen for tech-death fans. A lot of the album lacks the ear-worms that I really like, but that's just a preference thing when it comes to this genre."
4/12,Blue Oyster Cult,LP,Ghost Stories,Rock,6.5,"Its an easy listen but nothing special. I like the band and its cool that they continue to keep putting out half decent releases, but theres not a lot new here to experience. If you like chill, old-school rock, this is right up your alley."
4/12,Love Sex Machine,LP,TRVE,Sludge Metal,5.5,"Kinda dissapointed, idk why but I expected more. Its pretty standard sludge (which is a genre I struggle to enjoy) and it doesn't really go anywhere sonically. Sounds pretty much like the same song for the entire runtime. I'd skip unless you're super into sludge. People seem to like it and it seems well done, so can't give it too low of a score."
4/12,Heresiarch,LP,Edifice,Blackened Death Metal,5.8,"Does absolutely nothing for me. I think if you're into the genre you'd like it but I don't like raw death metal enough to vibe. It's super omninous and grody (in a good way), so if you like that sort of thing...."
4/12,Whores.,LP,War,Noise,4.9,"Kinda sludgey, kinda hard rock-y, a lot better than I expected it to be but I expected it to be truely horrendous. Its an easy enough listen but doesn't really do much for me. Not gonna finish nor will I return."
4/12,Mother of All,LP,Global Parasitic Leviathan,Melodic Death Metal,5.1,"Extremely mid, extremely forgettable, extremely formulaic melodic death metal. Ripping the style with no innovation, passion, or thought. I wouldn't waste your time on this one unless you're *reeaally* into melodeath."
4/12,Sarcasm,LP,Mourninghoul,Melodic Death Metal,4.9,"Extremely mid and forgettable. Just another drop in the sea of bland melo-death that is so damn popular now. It's well done, no major complaints on the sound itself, but literally not a damn thing interesting going on."
4/12,Khirki,LP,Κ​υ​κ​ε​ώ​ν​α​ς,Progressive Rock,7.5,"Damn, this is hella cool. Can't believe this came out of nowhere and is as strong as it is. It experiments with sound, keeps the pace moving up and down, has pretty good riffing, and overall good production/execution. I didn't fall in love or anything, but I think this slightly edges out Transit Method's Othervoid for better prog rock/metal release. If you liked Othervoid, definitely listen to this."
4/12,Exist,LP,Hijacking The Zeitgeist,Technical Death Metal,7.6,"I really liked the style of this one. Pretty interesting, pretty techy, has a decent amount of variance across the runtime to keep it interesting. Didn't knock my socks off or anything, but will definitely listen again."
4/12,Tarot,LP,Glimpse Of The Dawn,Progressive Rock,5.6,"Its ok, I dig the tone of the guitars and bass, and the presence of the organ, but the vocals are very meh. Writing wise i'm a little uninterested, doesn't really have anything ear grabbing riff-wise or melody-wise. Maybe if you're *real* into this style it could be for you, but I think most people won't care."
4/12,Northlane,EP,Mirror's Edge,Progressive Metalcore,7.0,"Kinda cool, a little boring sometimes. I don't really love the guitar (?) tone - its super sawtooth-y and loses some tonal information. Overall I do like it and didn't mind listening in full, I'd even listen again but I'm not dying to do so."
4/12,Adon,LP,Adon,Black Metal,7.1,"Decent black metal with some cool different stylings thrown around (proggy maybe?). Felt like their own take on the genre and not just a repackaging of the standard shit. Nothing incredible or super innovative, but a decent enough listen that kept me intrigued throughout the whole runtime."
4/12,Graufar,LP,Scordalus,Black Metal,4.8,"Imagine black metal but heavily influenced by modern heavy metal. I don't really like it at all - takes the parts I like least of both genres and merges them. I don't think most people would really appreciate it either because the target audience is so niche. The production and performance seems fine enough. Skip, don't bother."
4/13,Vulcano,LP,Epilogue,Death Metal,4.7,"Its mide, uninspired, bland death metal. Don't waste your time. I don't think any death metal fans will hear anything here that they haven't heard done better many times before."
4/13,In The Fire,LP,Test Of The Pendulum Blade,Technical Thrash Metal,8.4,"I like a lot of whats going on here. It has a pretty raw production sound which I think some people will like (I'm 50/50 on it). The guitar-playing is pretty strong - theres some cool old-school style trash riffing,some technical neoclassical passages, and even some cool heavy metal style jamming in parts. Theres a lot of variety even just within a single song. I think I'll have to listen to this again to appreciate. Vox are weakest link for me. Edit: Ok, on further listen, this is one of the best technical thrash albums I've heard since Terminal Redux by Vektor. Really, really solid instrumentation and songwriting. The production is definitely weak, but it has a certain charm for sure. The vox are still the weak IMO, but it's theyr'e not bad by any means - just not a style I'm vibing with very hard. I think thrash fans will like the music here. Original rating was 7.7, gonna bump it up"
4/19,Big|Brave,LP,A Chaos Of Flower,Post Metal,5.1,"I respect the experimental nature, but I just got kind of bored. Theres not a whole lot for your ear to grab onto - very open sound with disjointed melodies/chords/harmonies. The vocals are alright but nothing super special. I think most can skip this one. It's decently well executed but definitely not perfect (although I wonder if some of the 'imperfections' are quite intentional)"
4/19,In Vain,LP,Solemn,Progressive Death Metal,8.6,"I've been sleeping on In Vain, holy shit. This was RIGHT up my alley - reminds me a lot of Complex of Cages by Barren Earth. I love the clean, melodic vox sections, the harsh vocals are pretty damn good IMO, the general song structure and writing style really intrigues me. I'd say this is a MUST listen for prog death fans. Really good release that I've already listened to a few times."
4/19,Folterkammer,LP,Weibermacht,Symphonic Black Metal,6.1,"As far as Symphonic, Gothic-y metal goes, this is decent - problem is I just really, really struggle to enjoy this genre. I really can't get into the operatic vocals whatsoever. Musically its ok, nothing super special, but better than most gothic I'd say. Idk I'd skip but maybe if you're into this sort of thing you'll enjoy it."
4/19,Balance Of Power,LP,Fresh From The Abyss,Progressive Metal,5.8,Mid-ish progressive power metal. Nothing really noteworthy - doesn't sound terrible but nothing I'll listen to again. Execution sounds good but writing is pretty unoriginal.
4/19,Satanic North,LP,Satanic North,Black Metal,5.0,"Black metal is black metal. Nothing really new here. Its performed decently well and has a couple of decent riffs, but I'm not coming back for more. I don't think black metal dudes will think this really stands out from the noise either. Its fine"
4/19,Loch Vostok,LP,Opus Ferox II - Mark of the Beast,Progressive Metal,6.4,"Eh, didn't really do it for me. I get the feeling some people would vibe with this (not many, mind you) but it just didn't do much for me. No strong melodies, no strong riffing, but some good synth sections thrown around. Not really a vocal style that does much for me - its that Blaze Bailey style. Idk felt on the edge of pseudo-prog to me."
4/19,Bloody Falls,LP,Amartia,Melodic Death Metal,5.2,"Standard, uninspired, boring melo death. Nothing new or remotely interesting. God when will this genre die. At least make prog death metal or something for godssake. Idk man I'd skip it. It's really not THAT bad - I'm being a little dramatic. I've just heard this exact album an uncountable number of times and its beginning to weigh on my psyche."
4/19,My Dying Bride,LP,A Mortal Binding,Death Doom Metal,3.5,"I actually can't stand this. I really don't know who the hell listens to this shit. God doom is so fucking boring. The riffs are so goddamn weak and played out, then they run through them like 30 times and I want to kill myself. I hate this, I think the writing sucks, I think the vocals suck, I enjoyed no part of this and I don't recommend it. To end on a compliment, the mix/master/recording is flawless - instrument tone is perfect."
4/19,Selbst,LP,Despondency Chord Progressions,Black Metal,,
4/19,High On Fire,LP,Cometh The Storm,Sludge Metal,6.0,"I've always heard this name thrown around but I'm not sure I've ever actually listened before. And, while I see the appeal, I didn't really fall in love. They definitely nail their sludgey, proto-Mastodon style, but it started to feel very repititous to me. The year of the sludge meets its first minor 'L'. I'm guessing this is one of those instances where ""They did it first"" and everybody copied their sound into the ground."
4/19,Red Mesa,LP,Partial Distortions,Doom Metal,,
4/19,All Will Know,LP,Parhelion,Melodic Death Metal,6.4,"Slightly better than the mid-city that melodeath is these days, but not by a whole lot. More memorable riffing, better melodic lines, better vocals, and a couple of variations of tone and energy. Execution is pretty good - not sure the guitar tone is overall my favorite and the clean vox are a little weak. I still wouldn't say I really 'appreciate' it all that much, but I'm sure the meloheads out there can find something in here to make it worth the listen."

Stylistically, didn't really do a whole lot for me, but that's just personal preference. I think they have a unique sound and really hit he nail on the head trying to craft it. Worth a listen if you're into sludgey, harsh vox, slightly progressive metal."

4/19,Guenna,LP,Peak of Jin'Arrah,Progressive Stoner Metal,8.9,"Wow I realy liked this! I'm generally not a huge fan of the stoner metal sound/vibe, but they mixed in tons of progressive elements and rhythmic intricacies that kept it super intreresting. I love the vocals and the vocal harmonies - both male and femaale lead vox do a great job. A really like a lot of the riffs and guitar playing. Drums are on point. I really tink this is one of the best takes on stoner metal that I've heard in a long time. I think prog fans will find a lot to love in this - not sure how pure stoner guys would feel about it. If it were simply in a style that resonates a little more with me internatlly this would be a VERY strong release for the year. I recommend checking it out."
4/19,Maimed,LP,Propagate Onslaught,Brutal Death Metal,4.5,"Yep, it's brutal death. I'm bored - not my style and I've never even gotten close to getting into it. I literally can't even tell if this stuff is well executed or not. I guess they probably hit the mark they were shooting for?"

4/26,Alien Ant Farm,LP,Mantras,Alternative Metal,6.9,"I liked this more than I thought I would. It's not a style that really resonates very strongly with me; feels like a modern version of the alt-metal popular in the early 2000s. It was well produced and performed, somewhat catchy, and not a lot of bloat. I think fans of this style will appreciate it a bit, but I think this will fall just *into the 'skip' category for most."

Extremely formulaic music that they've been doing since the 90's (granted, they were ahead of their time back then). Its well done for what it is, but it just ain't my thing these days."

4/26,Inter Arma,LP,New Heaven,Sludge Metal,5.9,"Unfortunately, it seems to be getting harder and harder for me to get into their music as they continue releasing new stuff.

TONS of tonal variance across the album, hell one of the songs wouldn't sound out of place on the Wii main menu. Dynamic listen, kept me engaged from start to finish, don't think I necessarily 'vibed' with it super hard? But it was pleasant, interesting, well performed and executed, and theres a Devin Townsend cameo! (i believe he mixed/mastered this) Will definitely listen again"
4/26,Voidwomb,LP,Spiritual Apotheosis,Blackened Death Metal,5.0,"Pretty mid, not bad but not interesting. Lots of tremolo-picked melody lines, standard blackened death vox, and song structure. It's decently performed, but not really standout. I'd skip unless you really like this stile."

I hate to rip on em but there was really just nothing interesting here in my opinion. They sound good, but the writing and stylistic choices just aren't doing it for me. I really can't believe I'm about to give them a rating this low... Ok The Freeze is a decent song"

5/3,Ossilegium,LP,The Gods Below,Melodic Death Metal,5.1,"Super mid, but managed to listen to the whole thing. No comment really - it's standard melo death for these days. Not agony but will never listen again."
5/3,Ghost on Mars,LP,Out of Time and Space,Progressive Metal,6.0,"Pretty good music and melody overall. I like some of the riffing and guitar melody. The songwriting was initially inriguing, then it started to all feel the same. This is a lot better than the shitty pseudo-prog I rant about, but i'd probably put it toward the bottom of genuine prog. I'm definitely having mixed feelings, think I would recommend if you're a hardcore prog fan (but thats how I'd classify myself and i didn't love it...).The vocalist sometimes sounds like Pickles from Metalocalypse lmfao, his harsh vocals are very inconsistent - sometimes good sometimes... not. Shit, damn, there are some pretty sick sections in here - best song is 'That time I saw the moon'"

Maybe like some of the melo-death style riffing is good? I'm not sure man"
5/5,2 Wolves,LP,Not Worth It,Industrial Metal,,
5/3,Resuscitate,LP,Immortality Complex,Progressive Metal,8.3,"Really, really awesome release - can't believe I'm only finding it in October. Awesome writing, awesome tone, great pacing and variation, great vocal variety, just everything is performed at a very high level. Definitely needs another listen (or several) for me to fully appreciate. If I had to criticize something, I'd say the tone of the lead melodies on the guitar is a little abrasive and the melodies themselves are kinda mid. The math-rock riff style isn't my favorite thing in the world either, but I think they do it well regardless. Prognerds assemble - listen to this album."

5/10,Unleash The Archers,LP,Phantoma,Heavy Metal,6.7,"One of the more fresh iterations of a classic heavy metal sound I've heard in a while. Good female vox, good synth bits, good solo-ing, but on the whole nothing super special. It's a solid release and worth listening if *this* is your genre, but I suspect most will probably pass on it."
5/10,AfterTime,LP,Arcane Horizons,Symphonic Metal,5.2,"Something very 'odd' about the mixing - the lead vox sit very uncomfortably in the mix. She can definitely sing, but its nothing incredible. The backing music however is incredibly bland. Not really my style to begin with, but I think even symp/power metal fans won't really be taken with this either."

5/10,Necrophagia,LP,Moribundis Grim,Death Metal,3.6,"Ummmmmm, I'm gonna be lighter on these guys than I should be. Musically, its not the worst attempt at death metal I've ever heard. However, I have never heard an album with at least 5 different recording qualities across the run time. Songs go from sound Ok to utter dogshit. I don't know if there are live recordings strewn about, but it's very jarring. Its not particularly interesting or inventive, but it sounds like some guys with decent musical proclivities just having a grand 'ol time. Would not recommend."
5/10,Soziedad Alkoholika,LP,Confrontacion,Crossover Thrash Metal,5.6,"Not bad, but not really anything remotely new or interesting. Decent tone, decent song structure, decent riffing... this was listed out as crossover thrash, but I really don't think that's fitting. Maybe the lyrical content pushes it more in that direction, but it's in Spanish so I can't really understand much of it. I think everyone can skip."
5/10,Red Rot,LP,Borders of Mania,Atmospheric Death Metal,5.4,"Unbearably mid. Just nothing for my ear to grab - doom metal riffs with death metal vocals. Cool album art, and the music sounds fine, just not a style I'm enjoying at all."
5/10,Svneatr,LP,Never Return,Black Metal,5.5,"Very odd style. Not really accurate to call this plain 'ol Black metal - it has some synthy components, guitar solos, some more melodic sections, but very nasty black metal vocals. There are a handful of decent passages, but overall I think it doesn't quite resonate with me. I think most people probably won't get much out of this. I'll give some extra points for confusing me as to what to even classify this as."
5/10,Funeral Storm,LP,Chthonic Invocations,Black Metal,4.0,"Heavens no. Really not vibing with the vocals or the extremely repetitive riffing in the background. I don't really like any part of this, nor do I think it's particular well done. Don't think black metal fans would really fuck with this all that much."
5/10,Kill II This,LP,Variant,Alternative Metal,4.4,Indescribably bland. Don't waste your time.
5/10,The Metal Alliance,LP,Opus Fabularum,Heavy Metal,4.1,"Gross. Bad everything. I like the willingness to go between heavy and soft, but the soft sections suck worse than the heavy sections."
5/10,Jours Pales,LP,Dissolution,Melodic Death Metal (?),6.0,"Frog music, frog music. Doesn't fit cleanly into one genre - has some elements from post, melodeath, and black metal. There are some cool, slower, melodic passages that I like, but the rest of it is a litle forgettable to me. Post metal vox are typically a little harder for me to enjoy, but these are by no means bad. Its got a somewhat noisy tone overall. Far from a bad release, but one that just doesn't strike me in any memorable way. I think most can safely skip."
5/10,Flamekeeper,LP,Flamekeeper,Heavy Metal,7.5,"Legitamately one of the best heavy metal records I've heard in a while. Guy (it's just one dude i believe) has a really strong command of melody and harmony. It's not earthshattering or anything, but this is a really strong representation of what the genre could be if people with talent would actually make this style of music. Nice, chill, easy listen on a Friday morning. Pure heavy metal fans should absolutely listen to this."
5/10,Knocked Loose,LP,You Won't Go Before You're Supposed To,Hardcore,8.6,"Just an all out, balls to the wall, cannot-be-fucking-stopped, relentless album. Probably the single most extreme hardcore (?) album I've ever encountered. It's not really a style that vibes with me (no strong melodies or riffs) but I respect the energy. Slaughterhouse 2 probably has best riffing/instrumentation IMO. Sit & Mourn has best vibes - melancholic and depressive. EDIT: I have learned how to appreciate this sound... and holy shit. My ears have completely opened up to it. Sit & Mourn was my in-road, and after I found myself exploring the album more I just kept picking up track after track that was hitting me different. This is a VERY good album. I'm not sure I have the vocabulary or hardcore-experience to describe what I like about it, but the ferocity and vocal style have just really been growing on me. There's also this forboding sense of... suicide... under the whole thing. Theres just a darkness that I don't quite know how to explain. If you can get past any stylistic hang-ups and try to listen with very open ears, this is a must listen from this year."
5/10,Waste,LP,In Bloom,Deathcore,5.2,"This is just really not my thing. I don't connect with any part of it - guitars are extremely chuggy without very discernable riffs, the vocals are decent, the songwriting just isn't for me. Maybe you can check out if you're big into the nasty nasty deathcore."
5/10,Depressive Witches,LP,"Lost, Forgotten and Heartbroken",Blackened Heavy Metal,4.4,"Not really for me. It's a really weird style that I've never heard before - very standard heavy metal instrumentation and song structure, but with black-ish vocals. Boring riffing, mid vox, terrible lyricism. Would not recommend."
5/10,Darkness Everywhere,LP,To Conquer Eternal Damnation,Melodic Death Metal,6.9,"Pretty decent, easy melo death listen. Nothing groundbreaking, but good riffing, melodic lines, and alright vocals. Incorporates some very fast riffing not seen as often in melodeath so thats kinda nice. Not a super stand-out release, but I think melodic death fans could appreciate."
5/10,Desolus,LP,System Shock,Thrash Metal,,
5/10,Machiavellian God,LP,Beyond The Void,Melodic Death Metal,,
5/15,Shokran,LP,Duat,Progressive Metalcore,6.3,"Really does not do amything for me - really only slightly above my bar for ""pseudo-prog"". Musically, nothing caught my ear in terms of writing or performance. It's well executed and I can tell theres a cool, Egyptian god theme going on under the hood, but i didnt really follow it. Its like boring Monuments. I feel like *big* Monuments fans would like this though."
5/17,The Last Of Lucy,LP,Godform,Technical Death Metal,7.4,"Insanely technical, blindingly fast, really impressive instrumentation. I initially enjoyed a lot, but as the album ran the songs started to bleed together. I really liked the slower, cleaner sections as they broke up the pace nicely. Good listen for the tech-death inclined, but I needed a little more variety."
5/17,Slash,LP,Orgy of the Damned,Blues Rock,5.9,"With a name like this, I fully expected this to be a disgusting brutal death metal album. When that harmonica busted out on the first track I literally laughed out loud. Oh.... i realized 4 tracks in that this is Slash... woops. As far as blues rock goes, I think its a fun, well put-together album. Lots of guest artists, lots of fun covers... nothing to go crazy over but ya know its an album. They have a cover of Living For The City by Stevie Wonder, which is my favorite song by him, so that's fun."
5/17,Botanist,LP,Paleobotany,Experimental Black Metal,,
5/17,Marty Friedman,LP,Drama,Progressive Metal,8.4,"<3 Marty Frogman. God, I love his style so, so much. He sits in such a unique sound of technicality and passionate melody - I really don't know of anyone with a sound like his. Really enjoyed the album, super good vibes, good pacing, incredible guitar playing and tone, great tension and emotion building, just a good listen across the board. Its a little slower, more melodic, and less technical than a lot of his previous work, but it makes up for it in VIBE. I hard recommend."

5/17,Nocturnus AD,LP,Unicursal,Death Metal,,
5/17,Hemotoxin,LP,When Time Becomes Loss,Technical Thrash Metal,7.0,"I liked it more and more as it went on - it transitioned from a pretty blindingly fast, hypertechincal style of thrash into a more melodic style, though still very technical. I think I'd need to listen again to fully comprehend. Solid listen for thrash/tech fans, but didnt blow my socks off."

5/20,Blasteroid,LP,Crypts of Mind,Technical Death Metal,7.3,"Pretty enjoyable tech death! Stylistically, not may favorite thing ever, but it definitely hits a lot of the must-haves for tech death and I think most will appreciate it. Worth a listen for sure."
5/22,Azure,LP,Fym,Progressive Metal,8.1,"Very strong prog metal release - perhaps one of the strongest this year. Awesome musicianship and instrumentation along with pretty good song writing. Pretty good vocals (sounds a lot like new Dragonforce). To me, the back half gets a little stale and starts to bleed together. I think any prog fan will thoroughly enjoy this."
5/24,Rotting Christ,LP,Pro Xristou,Black Metal,6.1,"Honestly Rotting Christ is kinda boring to me nowdays. I respect the more symphonic, slower style, but it just doesnt do a whole lot for me. Not bad by any means - well produced and well executed, but not a genre that excites me."
5/24,Evildead,LP,Toxic Grace,Thrash Metal,,
5/24,Vredehammer,LP,God Slayer,Blackened Death Metal,6.3,"Not amazing, but far from a bad listen. Theres some cool music and riffs tossed around but its a little hit or miss. I had a hard time really grabbing onto a lot of the riffing or the vocals. I think if you like blackened death, you'll appreciate this, but if its not a genre youre into, I'd skip. Blood Of Wolves was most accessible track IMO"
5/24,Freak Kitchen,LP,Everyone Gets Bloody,Progressive Hard Rock,4.0,"Very boring musically, lyrically bad, stylistically played out. Would not recommend. Standard heavy rock with nothing new to give."

It's been really cool to see this band evolve their sound on EVERY album - they really haven't done the same thing twice. I absolutely loved their sophomore album 'II' and its really cool when you hear flashes of that tech death style on this record. I have some qualms with some of the mastering decisions - chiefly how the vocals feel very muddy and 'behind' the wall of sound created by the guitars and drums. On the other hand, I really love the absolutely gut wrenching tone on the guitars and just how loud everything is. The record undeniably sounds very good - I think it might just be a personal preference. This record goes really, really hard. Its totally unrelenting, never breaking pace or giving you a moment to breathe. It's insanely techincal, insanely fast, and really fun to listen to for me. I'll never be able to get past my longing for their 'II' style tech riffing, but there are elements of this album that I think I will learn to love. I think pure tech death fans might not connect as much on this record as their previous work (really just II), but I think they should give it a try."

I like some of the stylistic choices (prominent bass, technical riffing) but the overall sound just isn't my thing. I think the vocals a little weak and the overall songwriting just doesn't capture me. I don't think it's a bad record, just probably not my thing.

But the riffs here are *very* strong and the album has a generally fun feel to it. Decent song variety, thought it does lean toward 'monotone'. Decent vocals, nothing earth shattering but they get the job done. I probably won't listen again because this style isn't really my thing, but I think fans of power metal fused with some thrashy/proggy elements will love it."

It still has that 'noisy' component to it that isn't my favorite, but over the course of the album there are lots of pace-changes, tonal-varieties, and ebbes/flows. Didn't blow me away or anything, but I did listen to it twice and mostly enjoyed it for what it is. I think for prog fellas that are grindcore-curious, this might be a good place to start."

I love everything about it - contender for strongest EP this year I expect. LISTEN to this"

It wasn't over-the-top proggy, but had some cool prog elements that really made it stand out from standard black metal. It was good enough that I wanted to listen again, so I think that's worth something"
6/7,Dysrhythmia,LP,Coffin Of Conviction,Technical Progressive Metal,4.9,"Pretty boring instrumetal IMO. I wouldn't recommend for vast majority of people. Parts of it are well executed, others are a little lackluster. Feels like a big mishmash of concepts with little structure between them ore any strong melody/harmony to tie anything together. Mix/master is a little subpar as well, but not bad."

Its kind of a doom-y, atmospheric death metal, and theres apmost no song-to-song variation for the full runtime. It wasnt agony, but theres never a single moment of a song that pulled me in. I hear a lot of people praising this album, so maybe if youre into this style you'll really like it. For most others, I'd suggest skipping."

To my inexperienced ear, I really love the progressive elements - I think they really elevate it above standard sludge. It's a quick little EP to get through and I think it has more broad appeal than to just sludge fans. I would recommend listening!"
6/21,Seven Spires,LP,A Fortress Called Home,Progressive Power Metal,7.9,"Really one of the better power metal acts I've heard in a while. Awesome, techincal instrumentation, yet they still manage to build amazing, emotional swells. Truly great vocalist that sets them apart from a lot of other power metal bands IMO - not to ignore the rest of the band as they are killer as well. Never heard a bass go this hard in power metal. Really nice melodies and riffing - some moments of very impressive technicality. I'm not a huge power metal fan by and large, but I enjoyed this pretty wholly, which I think speaks for itself. I think most can at least get some sort of enjoyment out of this - check this bad boy out."

Very loud, very noise, very fast, very heavy, but everything kind of drones together. Probably just not my style of music tbh. Though I'm not sure this would be anybody's favorite instance of the genre. It's mixed/mastered decently as far as I can tell - a bit muddy on the guitars but I think that's intentional. I think vast majority can skip this one."

6/21,Greenleaf,LP,The Head & The Habit,Stoner Rock,7.6,"Ya know, I think I'm really coming around on stoner rock/metal. I really dig the vibe and the tone. This reminds me of a chiller, more laid back 'Moontooth' who I also like a lot. Good song-to-song variation, good riffing, very good vocals (to me), and just absolutely crushing the vibe they are shooting for. My stoner-noob opinion is this is a must listen for the stoner rock crowd."

That being said I think the songwriting is a little weak to me, which sucks to say because the individual components are so strong. Theres tons of song-to-song variation, and even a high level of intra-song variation. Theres a massive, 25 minute epic at the end to look forward to. Maybe I'm not giving this thing a fair shake, idk. I think prog nerds will like/appreciate it a lot, and they should listen to it. I will certainly listen again."

6/21,King Bastard,EP,From Whence They Came,Sludge Metal,7.5,"Nice and sludgey. Enjoyed this more and more as it went on. They really just sit and dwell on riffs and motifs, slightly building and increasing tension until it boils over.

Theres some cool incorporation of string elements that set it apart a little from other sludge/post styles. The vocals are this kind of weird whispery, weak delivery the whole time that I didn't really like too much, but it definitely served their vibe. Listen if you appreciate post stuff"
7/2,Aeons,LP,The Ghosts Of What We Knew,Progressive Metal,9.0,"God DAMN. Where the fuck has this been all year. This is one of the sweetest heavier prog albums I've heard this year. The riff in the middle of Ghosts is sooo Opethian.... Loads of song variety over the album, mix of harsh and clean vocals (both of which are done very well). Incredible instrumentation, awesome heavy riffing, man I just can't say enough nice things. This is sincerely one of the strongest releases of this year I think (after a single listen). Progheads listen NOW. I will be relistening soon."
7/5,Akhlys,LP,House of the Black Geminus,Blackened Death Metal,7.3,"Reminds me a lot of the new Vale Of Pnath album. It's good for what it is, but the whole thing kinda bleeds together for me. I like the darkened tone and in general they absolutely nail the vibe they're going for. Overall I think its a pretty decent record, but there aren't very many memorable moments for me. I think its a great representation of the genre that fans can get behind."
7/5,Octoploid,LP,Beyond The Aeons,Progressive Death Metal,8.7,"Blessed is the day... FINALLY a prog death metal release this year. Slake my thirst dear Octoploid! I really enjoyed this! This is, like, my favorite genre ever so I'm a very biased, but theres so much that I look for in prog. Tons of variation across the album, healthy mix of harsh and cleans, great instrumentation and songwriting - really just everything I enjoy about progressive death metal. I think the execution could be improved a little - recording quality sounds a little rough around the edges (to be fair i'm listening on dogshit headphones at the moment). I think progressive fans and especially progressive death fans have to listen to this."

7/5,Cryptic Hatred,LP,Internal Torment,Death Metal,6.6,"Pretty decent death metal release to my ears. Really just locks in on a pretty standard death metal sound and hammers it home. There are some occasional melodic passages and slower sections, but for the most part it's pretty fast, heavy, and dark. Nothing super new, but if you're into this sound it really drives it. Solid release but nothing special."
7/5,Piah Mater,LP,Under The Shadow Of A Foreign Sun,Progressive Death,6.9,"Decent, but not my favorite prog death release this year (of the whopping 3 releases...). There are aspects that I like a lot, such as the album variation and intra-song variation. Great clean vox passages, some really cool brass-oriented passages, and pretty good heavy sections. Overall, however, I was left a little....bored. I hate saying that shit jfc. I respect everything about the album but I don't think it quite hit the mark with me. Has a lot of the same energy as Gwynnbleidd's album 'Nostalgia'. I think surely some other prog-death dudes will love this, but it just didn't click with me. Great execution and mix/master."
7/5,Krallice,LP,Inorganic Rites,Avantgarde Black metal,,
7/11,Eremit,EP,Rise Of The Ruan~Angh,Sludge Metal,6.8,"Very sludgey, very very sludgey. As far as pure sludge goes, I actually enjoyed this a bit. Probably won't listen again soon, but it was chill, easy grooves to work to. There are some pretty good riffs that they dwell on for so long and I loved it. Some good atmospheric sections too. I think if you're into the genre you'd get a kick out of it (especially the saxaphone at the end of track 1) but I think you do need to be a sludge fan going in."

Ian Gillian's vocals have very noticably aged, but you can't hold that against the man. Of course, this is not gonna be anything new or ground breaking. It is, however, a good repackaging of that old 70's rock sound in the modern era. I think rock fans will appreciate, but won't go crazy over."

7/19,Atavistia,EP,Inane Ducam (I Will Lead Into Nothingness),Melodic Death Metal,7.9,"Really good! Reminds me a lot of ""King"" by Fleshgod Apocalypse - in fact the song Dark Isolation is... *very* similar to The Fool. Lots of cool symphonic components, extremely fast, great harsh and clean vox, pretty interesting riffs, and constantly moving onto the next thing. One of the better EPs this year I think. It really does seem like it's trying to replicate Fleshgod Apocalypse to me, so I've gotta take some points for originality."
7/19,Orange Goblin,LP,"Science, Not Fiction",Sludge Rock,6.0,"Better than mid, worse than good. Theres some good moments, but the whole album really sounds like one song repeated 9 times. Not very much variation in tone or style, which is something I value a lot. They definitely lock into their style a,d drive it home."

7/22,Assemble the Chariots,LP,Ephemeral Trilogoy Episode 1: Unyielding Night,Symphonic Deathcore,7.5,"This is a pretty damn good take on symphonic deathcore! Extremely well done - performances are top notch, symphonic components sound pretty good, great vocals, great instrumentation. To me, the album bleeds together quite a bit and is pretty monotonous. Not a huge fan of the power metal cleans, but thats just me. Overall, this is really a lot closer to a symphonic power metal album with deathcore vocals. If you're into that sort of thing, this is for you. I respect the execution fully, but not really my style."
7/24,Orpheus Omega,LP,Emberglow,Melodic Death Metal,6.0,"Melo-death with some strong metalcore influences on the song writing and some of the passages, especially the choruses. Not too bad, but I didn't really connect with it. Pretty decent riffing and soloing, but I don't think I connected with the melodies very well. Mid, edging on decent."
7/25,Valsa Pintura,EP,Plenitude,Progressive Metal,6.5,"Middle of the road prog instrumental. Not super impressive, sounds a little uninspired, but I'm *very* picky about prog instrumental. It's by no means bad, and I think fans of the style will like it a lot more than me, but it didn't do much for me at all. Execution is flawless, mixing/mastering seems pretty good as far as I can tell. The oboe/clarinet/bassoon sweeps on the last song are sick lol."
7/26,A Wake in Providence,LP,"I Write To You, My Darling Decay",Symphonic Technical Death Metal,7.6,"Right off the bat i'm really liking it - theres this new-ish (i don't even know if thats true) trend of symphonic/neoclassical tech death, and I'm HERE for it."

7/26,Cold Cell,LP,Age Of Unreason,Black Metal,,
7/26,Abyssielle,LP,Through Sun And Stone,Melodic Black Metal,7.6,"I really love the style, but I think most people wouldn't appreciate it very much. This might be one of those that just matches my vibes perfectly today. Very calm, relaxing, melodic, pleasant, then it has the cool black metal components on top. I think fans of astmospheric or chill black could get a kick out of this. I'll probably rate higher than it deserves, but it just hit good today. UPDATE: listened to this again, forgot i had heard it before, and came back to leave it a similar rating. 2 listens and still enjoying so.... for what it's worth"
7/26,Wormwitch,LP,Wormwitch,Black Metal,4.0,Sooooo fucking meh. Boring boring boring. Not bad but boring.
8/1,JPEGMAFIA,LP,I LAY DOWN MY LIFE FOR YOU,Experimental Hip Hop,8.6,"Damn I actually really liked this. I think the beginning might be a little tough for some to get into, but as the album progresses it just gets better and better. Layering choral sections, symphonic sections, electronic parts, and more. The subject matter is extremely dark and personl which I really like. I think anyone that appreciates hip hop or music on the slighly more experimental side of things will really enjoy. Has some Deathgrips vibes - maybe closer to clipping."
8/2,A Night In Texas,LP,Digital Apocalpyse,Technical Deathcore,6.1,"Kinda bland tech deathcore. Didn't do much for me at all. Good execution but a lot of deathcore is boring, formulaic, and very 'rinse and repeat' to me. Not sure this would register high with the deathcore dudes either. Idk maybe if you're a huge fan give this a shot."

8/9,Ghost Iris,EP,M.U.R.K.,Deathcore,5.2,"Really not a deathcore guy. Didn't connect with it, thought it was bland and a little cheesy. Kinda boring. Wouldn't recommened unless you really dig the style i guess."
8/9,Oxygen Destroyer,LP,Guardian Of The Universe,Thrash Metal,,
8/9,Ashen Horde,LP,Decayed,Progressive Black Metal,4.7,"Soooo meh...  this is the first time i've gotten 'pseudo-prog' vibes from a prog black metal record. Idk, just none of the 'prog' elements even remotely grabbed me. Vocals are mid, song writing and riffing is very mid and bland. Maybe just not my thing. I wouldn't really recommend this to anyone... but I'm sure somebody out there loves this stuff."
8/16,Dark Tranquility,LP,Endtime Signals,Melodic Death Metal,6.0,"I feel like Dark Tranquility these days sounds like all the bands trying to sound like Dark Tranquility. It was a decent listen but it just didn't have what I used to like about them. They're of course better than the hundreds that try to walk in their footsteps, but time gets the best of us all. Maybe i'm just jaded on the whole melodeath phase we appear to be in. I imagine melodeath fans will enjoy, didn't really impact me much though. Obviously the record sounds great - literally no problems with the performance, mix, or master."
8/16,Robse,LP,Harlekin und Krieger,Melodic Death Metal,,
8/16,Extinction A.D.,LP,To The Detested,Crossover Thrash Metal,5.5,"Eh, mid/decent thrash. Not bad at all but not really grippin me. I think i've just heard a trillion similar thrash albums at this point and they really have to have a unique sound to stand out now. Good riffing, great mix/master, very well executed overall."
8/16,Evilyn,LP,Mondestrunken,Avantegarde Death Metal,4.2,"I appreciate the avantegarde-ness, but i'd be lying if i said i enjoyed it. Nothing for the ear to grab on to, nothing you can really remember or recognize as the song goes. Just lots of weird dissonant little diminished runs up and down over some death metal chords. Not sure who this is for"
8/16,Cemetery Filth,LP,Senses of Detriment,Death Metal,4.8,It's death metal alright. No notes - it's been done one trillion times. This album has been made... one trillion times.
8/16,Vile Rites,LP,Senescence,Progressive Death Metal,,Sick album! Finally the progressive death meal seems to be rolling out with some consistency.
8/16,Blind Monarch,EP,The Dead Replenish The Earth,Doom Metal,,
8/16,Thermality,LP,The Final Hours,Melodic Death Metal,,
8/16,Svrm,EP,Мовчання І Смерть,Atmospheric Black Metal,4.9,"Great attempt at the genre, production exeuction is seriously lacking. I really can't imagine the end goal was for this to sound as muddy as it does. This is really unfortunate because I think it sounds decent underneath all the mud. It's honestly a decent stab at atmos black. They definitely could have changed the pace up a few more times to keep everything fresh, but that's not exactly what the genre is known for. Check it out if you like the genre, otherwise skip for sure."

8/23,Within The Ruins,LP,Phenomena II,Technical Deathcore,6.1,"I was initially pretty into it, but as the album went I lost interest. Didn't really change up the sound or style at all to keep me engaged. They do a great job at nailing their one sound, but personally I like more variety. Very techincal, impressive guitar work, drums didn't stand out too much to me, vocals decent. Worth a listen if you like deathcore but I don't think it's a stellar release or anything."
8/23,Paralydium,LP,Universe Calls,Progressive Metal,,
8/23,Kingcrow,LP,Hopium,Progressive Metal,7.3,"Not a bad progressive release. I struggled to connect with it, but there's nothing glaringly 'wrong' with it. Well produced, well executed, good song structure, good instrumentation, overall a pretty solid release. I think it lacks the *exact* emotional qualities (tonally, not thematically) that most resonates with me. Also slightly overstays its welcome in my opinion. Worth a listen for the prog dudes - one of the better-ish pure prog albums that I can remember coming out this year."

8/23,Fostermother,LP,Echo Manor,Psychadelic Doom Metal,,
8/23,Dawn Treader,LP,Bloom & Decay,Blackgaze,7.7,"I liked this a lot more than I expected! Very dark, very depressing, very ominious, very good. You definitely need to be in the right headspace for this - I think I was lucky to be in the right mood. You walk away from this one with a certain feeling of heaviness and weight. I'd recommend to listen on a cold, rainy day or something. The last song 'Bloom & Decay' does a really good job at leaving you on a somewhat uplifting note."
8/28,Cane Hill,EP,Permanence in Sleep,Metalcore,6.6,"Not bad, I like some of the dreamy guitar/synth parts and the vocals are pretty decent - good cleans (albeit maybe... cheesy? idk just very on-par for the genre) and pretty good harsh. The riffing didn't really capture me, but it wasn't bad by any stretch. It's a quick, easy, pleasant-enough listen that anyone vaguely interested in metalcore/deathcore should be able to enjoy. It definitely captures a unique vibe that I really appreciate."

8/30,Wintersun,LP,Time II,Extreme Power Metal,,
8/30,Amiensus,LP,"Reclamation, Pt. II",Progressive Black Metal,6.5,"Pretty decent prog black - definitely leans more toward the black and less toward the prog. (just want to distinguish this between something like Xanthochroid which is far proggier). Didn't blow me away, but there were sections I certainly enjoyed - it didn't overstay it's welcome and was generally just a pretty easy listen. On my list to likely revisit if I have time."
8/30,Pneuma Hagion,LP,From Beyond,Blackened Death Metal,,
8/30,Deliver The Galaxy,LP,Bury Your Gods,Melodic Death Metal,6.0,"Very mid/good, standard melodeath these days. Did not stand out, had extremely cheesy, cliche lyrics, and no memorable riffage or passages. It sounds 'good' and is executed fine, but not memorable. I wouldn't bother unless you love this genre."
8/30,Concrete Winds,LP,Concrete Winds,Death Metal,4.7,"I really can't do it. Mega dissonant, extremely fast, overly chaotic, just not my thing. I think they probably hit the nail on the head in terms of what they were shooting for, I just can't say I like that end product. If you want the fastast, craziest, over-the-top death metal out there, then check this out."
8/30,Ellende,LP,Todbringerin,Atmospheric Black Metal,7.8,"Way, way better than I anticipated. Super melancholic, awesome rainy-day-listening vibes. Theres good pacing between the dreary, atmospheric passages and the more upbeat, black metal sections. Overall just a very easy listen that keeps you intrigued from front to back. Easy recommend for any atmos black fans. I think it's a good representation of what the genre can do these days, but I don't think it will turn enough heads outside of the genre."
8/30,Other World,LP,Tenebrous,Atmospheric Black Metal,4.9,"Eh didn't do it for me. A little too... perhaps 'noisy' is the word? Very much has a harsh tone that kinda pulls me out of the atmospheric vibe they're going for. Vocals weren't my favorite, guitar tone bothered me, idk maybe just wasn't my thing"
8/30,Sur Austru,LP,Datura Strahiarelor,Black Metal,7,"Cool concept - kind of a symphonic, riff-based black metal album. I think whoever mixed this really did them dirty, as it just does NOT sound good. Musically theres some cool elements, such as flute passages and slower, rhythmic, melancholic verses. But man the vocals are just ruining it for me - they sit on top of everything else and don't sound like a cohesive part of the mix. Overall a cool album with some flawed execution. Update: Oh man it actually gets so much cooler as it goes - still has the same mixing problem but really is even more of a shame. bumping up the score a little"
8/30,Erronaut,LP,The Space Inbetween,Stoner Metal,7.5,"So begins my stoner metal arch. Damn I'm just loving the vibe of this style lately, and I think these guys killed it. My ear isn't as well attuned to this subgenre yet to know if this was particularly good or not, but it sounded good to me and I enjoyed it the entire way through. Would recommend for listening during work and just setting the mood."
8/30,Chelsea Wolfe,EP,Undone,Experimental Rock,4.9,"My last listen of her stuff was *extremely* charitable. I'm really not seeing the appeal, honestly. Maybe if I was in a better mood I'd be charitable again."
8/30,Oceano,LP,Living Chaos,Deathcore,7.2,"This feels like a much more matured version of the band, and I respect that growth a lot. I always felt like some of their previous work was goofy and heavy-for-the-sake-of-heavy. This feels like a cohesive album that establishes a tone and tries to pursue it over the whole album. Good riffing with some floaty, ethereal synth stuff going on in the background. I do like Adam's old gurgle gurgle growls, but I do think he's a little more effective in this register. I tink Oceano fans and deathcore fans in general will enjoy this. I liked it more and more as I got into it. But fellas, bring back the 'Ascendants' era album art - shit slapped."
8/30,thrown,LP,EXCESSIVE GUILT,Deathcore,4.9,"Pretty modern deathcore, with all the cheesy corniness that that genre loves. It's an OK listen - I don't love this genre to begin with so it's certainly an uphill battle. It's well produced and seems to be achieving what it set out to do. Even so, I just think some of the stylistic decisions will turn off some of the deathcore fans that might otherwise like this."
9/1,The Sinsemillian,LP,The Collective Conscious,Stoner Metal,6.8,"Hm ok maybe I do have a sense of what stoner rock I do/don't like. Not sure why exactly, but this one didn't grasp me nearly as well as that Erronaut album (i listened to these two in sequence). I think the vocals didn't quite do it for me? The riffing was decent, I liked the synth parts (kinda), .... yea not sure, just didn't click with me. I think bigger stoner fans would probably like it..."
9/2,Mindwars,LP,V,Thrash Metal,5.9,"Decent thrash metal with very mid, heavy-metal style vocals. Some of the riffing is actually pretty sweet - I really liked 'The Road to Madagascar'. Overall kinda forgettable, but far from the worst modern thrash of this year."
9/6,Wolfheart,LP,Draconian Darkness,Melodic Death Metal,,
9/6,Officium Triste,LP,Hortus Venenum,Death Doom Metal,6.7,"Pretty good atmospheric death doom. Didn't blow my pants off or anything, but it was a chill enjoyable listen with enough ebbes and flows to keep me mostly engaged. Probably won't listen again as it's not a subgenre that super resonates with me, but didn't hate it by any means."
9/6,Jordan Rudess,LP,Permission To Fly,Progressive Metal,7.9,"Damn, what an awesome album. I always get worried with Jordan Rudess types that it will end up just being a big 'ol synth wank-fest, but that's not remotely true here. Tons of great song writing, emotional builds and swells, great melodies, enough wanking to satisfy me ;), and decent pacing. I think a lot of the songs start to bleed together, but I enjoy the style enough that it didn't bother me as much. I'm praising a lot, but it isn't an earth shattering album - it sounds like what you would expect from Dream Theater if they let Rudess do ALL the writing, which has it's pros and cons. I think prog heads will get a great kick out of this though. Give 'er a listen."
9/6,Black Sites,LP,The Promised Land?,Progressive Metal,6.3,"Not bad, but not crazy impressive or anything. Decent vibes with several stand-out sections, but a lot was kinda forgettable to me. I think it's a decent listen for anyone proggy, thought it does have a distinctly 'heavy metal' feel to it. Not bad not great."
9/6,Eldamar,LP,"Astral Journeys, Pt. 1: Creation",Atmospheric Black Metal,,
9/6,Pyrrhon,LP,Exhaust,Technical Death Metal,4.1,"Gross, noisy bullshit. I can tell I won't make it through this whole thing. Technical chops are there but the style is just not for me. Vocals sound poorly recorded."
9/6,Bloody Valkyria,LP,Kingdom In Fire,Melodic Black Metal,,
9/6,Blackstaff,LP,The Storyteller,Sludge Metal,4.8,"The year of the sludge seems to be coming to an end for me. I've really liked so many of the sludgey releases this year but they're certainly tapering off. This just felt so, so slow and aimless. Managed to get through the whole thing, but the moment the next album came on was a wave of relief. I'd just skip this one."
9/13,Winterfylleth,LP,The Imperious Horizon,Atmospheric Black Metal,,
9/13,Oceans Of Slumber,LP,Where Gods Fear To Speak,Progressive Metal,,
9/13,Siderean,LP,Spilling The Astral Chalice,Progressive Death Metal,5.6,"Didn't do it for me. Kinda noisy with not a ton going on at times. Feels like a very young band swinging for the stars, but missing a little. It's pretty dissonant which is something i'm still trying to figure out how to enjoy. I feel like this is RIGHT up somebodies alley - maybe FFO the new Ulcerate album? I really didn't connect here."
9/13,Shadow and Claw,LP,Whereabouts Unknown,Blackened Sludge Metal,,
9/13,156/Silence,LP,People Watching,,,
9/13,Vvilfred,EP,Let The Water Flow,Post Punk,5.5,"What a ride. I actually hate the first song, but the album changes pretty significantly over it's run time. 'Sun' is probably my favorite. Wouldn't say I really *enjoyed* the whole thing, but I was definitely on the edge of my seat wondering what could possible come next. You can probably skip"
9/15,Ubiquity,LP,The Ascendant Travels Among the Stars,Extreme Progressive Metal,8.7,"Awesome album, very very cool. Probably one of the best spiritual successors to heavy Opeth that I've heard in a while. Really nice riffing, sweet harsh vocals, and decent variation and pacing. I think the one thing that this group could use to really hit the next level is to have more variety within a single song - sometimes the song itself kind of bleeds together from beginning to end. It would be amazing to hear some crazy left turns within a song. Great album fellas, very well done."
9/20,Glacial Tomb,LP,Lightless Expanse,Death Metal,6.3,"Sick album art. Decent death metal, but didn't grip me. Started to all feel the same as it went. Kinda sits right on the edge of technical death metal and traditional death metal. Mix is decent but not amazing - vocals get lost a little bit. Great instrumentation, especially from the bassist. Overall not bad, just not my personal favorite."
9/20,Kublai Khan TX,LP,Exhibition Of Prowess,Metalcore,5.5,"Not really my thing. A couple of good riffs strewn about, but overall it's just kinda the same song over and over again. Would be fun as hell in a pit, but, to me, not so much for casual listening. Execution is excellent and I think anybody that likes the slam-adjacent metalcore stuff will enjoy."
9/20,Dungeon Crawl,LP,Maze Controller,Thrash Metal,8.1,"Shit like this actually gives me hope for the future of thrash. As someone who originally got into metal from the classic 80s/90s thrash bands, I hate seeing the development of the genre grind to a halt as bands repackage the same sound that has been beaten into the mud for the last 30 years. This was a great breath of fresh air, yet still hit everything I would want to hear in a thrash record. Kinda cheesy, but in an awesome, fun way. Cool symphonic, dungeon-y synth stuff in the back that I liked a lot. Good, good stuff."
9/20,Untervoid,LP,Parasite,Progressive Black Metal,7.2,"Very conflicted about this one! There are some very, very cool progressive elements that are right up my alley. Great ebbe and flow of the album, good amount of tonal variation, pretty good writing, and decent instrumentation. My only hang-up is just the dark tone! It's weird it doesn't typically bother me, but theres a definite 'darkness' to the sound and tone that is just a little unsettling to me. I'm very impressed that an album can even make me feel this way these days, so I have to give it to them on that one. I think it's worth a listen for people that like prog-ish, deep, dark, black metal. It's well executed I think, and does a really incredible job at building a tone in the listeners mind. I think the clean vocals are a little weak and definitely stand out."
9/20,Crimson Sun,LP,Sorrowbreaker,Symphonic Metal,5.8,"Idk, wasn't really my thing. Not sure I'd really call it 'symphonic', just very synth heavy. It's not bad, I just don't really connect with it too much. I found the songs bleeding together a lot. I think most can probably skip, but surely someone out there that is really into women vox and that symph-y sound can appreciate."
9/20,Battle Tales,LP,Greed of a King,Folk Metal,6.0,"Mid, bordering on decent folk metal. Nothing super memorable for me, but it's not a genre i was that interested in at the outset. I think there were some small prog-ish elements that caught my attention here and there. Execution-wise, it's pretty good. I think the cleans kind of sit on top of the mix in a jarring way - my only complaint."
9/20,Blighted Eye,LP,Agony's Bespoke,Progressive Death Metal,7.0,"Album sounded great - production on point, execution excellent, stylistically I liked, but it started to kind of blend together as it went. Not a ton of variance, but when they did change up the pace I loved it. All said and done, prog-death fans should listen and enjoy."
9/20,Avneya,LP,Road to I,Progressive Metal,7.6,"For some reason I didn't expect much, but it was actually pretty decent! I think the vocals are somewhat weak, but theres good variation, good instrumentation, and all around decent writing/musicianship. I think execution might be a little sub-par, but nothing I can't get past. Mix/master is a little weak at times. Worth a listen for the prog-heads, i'd say."
9/27,Ingurgitating Oblivion,LP,Ontology of Nought,Technical Death Metal,6.5,"I respect the ferocity, complexity, and technicality, but the mix is so muddy I really can't make out much of what is going on. The album consists of 5 songs (split into sub-songs) that are each 10+ minutes long. The ambition and passion drips from the record, but I really am just having a hard time getting into it. There are several softer, clean sections that are pretty refreshing when juxtaposed to the insanity of the rest of the tracks, but even these are a little hard to make out what is going on. Fans of dissonant death metal will love this. I respect the effort here, but I really am just not getting pulled in - I think due to the execution of the mixing."
9/27,The Black Dahlia Murder,LP,Servitude,Melodic Death Metal,6.1,"Meh pretty bland and forgettable IMO. I know these guys are super respected in the community, but I really don't see the big deal. Very forgettable melodies, boring riffs, cookie-cutter melo-death. I'm starting to wonder if my boredome with melodic death metal is just me... no no... it's ALL OF MELODEATH that's the problem... Excecution is perfect - no complains there. I think unless you already like the band, probably just skip."
9/27,Ars Veneficium,LP,The Lurking Shadow of Death,Melodic Black Metal,5.2,"Nothing incredible. Really didn't connect with me at all. Somewhat muddy sound, vox didn't intrigue me, trem-picking forgettable melodies, and overall bland songwriting. Idk man, I'd say skip. It's not that poorly executed but it aint amazing."
9/27,OCEANS,LP,HAPPY,Metalcore,5.7,"Eh, I really didn't connect with this. I respect the artistry, but it's just a style I'm struggling to vibe with. I find a lot of the lyrics kind of corny, and the clean vox sit odd in the mix (only on some of the tracks). It's well executed for the most part, but the writing and style isn't for me. It has some small 'post metalcore' vibes going on if you're into that."
9/27,Ripped to Shreds,LP,Sanshi,Death Metal,5.4,"Pretty standard death metal. Didn't love it, didn't hate it. Personally, didn't really do much for me, and even if you're a big death metal fan I don't think this will impress you much. It's well executed, but very, very standard."
9/27,Interloper,LP,A Forgotten Loss,Progressive Metalcore,8.4,"Really awesome sound, stylistically I'm really getting into it. Its pretty distinct - has some almost sludgey factors, but fast and intricate riffing. Intense passages followed by slow, melodic guitar work. I think this is one of the stronger releases this year over all, and you should definitely check it out."
9/27,Savage Existence,LP,Bright Lights,Heavy Metal,6.0,"Good 'ol heavy metal, maybe a slight 'groove' affectation on it. It's pretty decent but nothing incredible. Was a quick, easy listen that didn't make me wanna dig my ears out. There's a lot more out there I'd recommend giving your attention to before this, though. I will say, their take on 'Killing In The Name' is super fun and worth checking out I think."
9/27,Munarheim,LP,Heimkehr,Melodic Black Metal,,
9/27,Serj Tankian,EP,Foundations,Alternative Metal,5.8,"Nothing but respect for Serj. I didn't love this. There were some memorable moments (maybe 1 per song). A *lot* of it sounds poorly executed - vocals sound almost out-of-key at times, vox mixing has them sometimes pasted very cruedly on top of the rest of the mix, and other such fuebles. Songwriting wise, I respect the Serj-style, but just don't really vibe with it much. I like the subject matter and messages, but just doesn't artistically resonate with me. I think SOAD fans should give it a shot though and see what they think. I wasn't aware he was still putting stuff out so that's pretty cool."
9/27,Deceitome,LP,Deceitome,Death Metal,5.1,"Pretty raw, unforgiving death metal. It's got that almost 'sawtooth' guitar tone (that I personally don't care as much for) that brings some serious nast to the sound. It's not bad, but it didn't really do much for me. Probably a pass for most people except the mega deathheads."
10/1,Lords of the Trident,EP,V.G.E.P.,Heavy Metal,6.8,"Just some good 'ol fashioned, fun heavy metal. Not too serious a really light tone throughout. Nothing super intriguing, but upbeat and enjoyable. Probably would have gotten a little bored if it were a full length, but EP was perfect length and pace. Not a style that does a whole lot for me, but I can enjoy it in this dosage."
10/3,Sylosis,EP,The Path,Metalcore,5.2,Meh metalcore. There were some 'progressive' stylistic flairs but it all felt kind of hollow to me. I'm probably just not in a great mood today and being harsher than it deserves. Well executed but I wouldn't really recommend. It's not bad just boring.
10/4,Devenial Verdict,LP,Blessing of Despair,Progressive Death Metal,8.8,"Really awesome listen for me. It's got this thick, dark tone on the production that just drips off the instruments. Very darkened sound. I've already listened multiple times and would recommend to anyone that enjoys progressive death. The second track has this nasty, driving beat that I think has more broad appeal."
10/4,Lowen,LP,Do Not Go To War With The Demons Of Mazandaran,Doom Metal,7.0,"Very, very unique sound. Its a cool combination of these sort of 'Dune' soundtrack vocal wails in that middle-east scale, but over some rich, doom metal guitars and drums. There's not really any adventuring outside of this very narrow sound, but the sound itself is fun for a while. Personally, I'd like to see a little more experimentation across the album - it starts to bleed together pretty quickly. Overall it's a pretty quick listen and kept me mostly engaged."
10/4,Temple Of Dread,LP,God of the Godless,Death Metal,5.1,"Very mid, very forgettable. I wouldn't bother - theres nothing here you couldn't get from a trillion other, better death metal releases. Not to knock the band too much - they executed it very well, stylistically it's just been done before and done better."
10/4,LIVLOS,LP,The Crescent King,Melodic Death Metal,6.8,"Decent melodic death, but nothing super special IMO. I've just heard so, so many of these albums at this point. The execution is great, better riffing than average, better melodic lines than average, decent vocals - really no major complaints aside from the fact that I think the genre is growing increasingly stale. Soft recommend if you're a melodeath fan."
10/4,Blood Incantation,LP,Absolute Elsewhere,Progressive Death Metal,9.0,"Bro... what an album. Just an awesome adventure from beginning to end. From brutal, to haunting, to spacey, to thrashy - incredible pacing and variation. I was intrigued the entire way through - I often find that albums are slightly too long for their own good, but this was a rare instance where I was sad it was over. An absolute must-listen for anybody that likes their death metal with a little weirdness thrown in."
10/4,Maul,LP,In the Jaws of Bereavement,Death Metal,5.2,"Just some death metal. A bit slower and riffier than a lot of stuff these days which is a good change of pace. Didn't really do anything for me - pretty forgettable riffs, meh melodies, and, bland writing. Execution is fine in terms of mixing, vox might be a little quiet at times but not too bad. I'd probably skip if I were you."
10/4,Cosmic Putrifaction,LP,Emerald Fires Atop The Farewell Mountains,Death Metal,5.1,"Really not a fan of the mix - suuuuper muddy and noisy, extremely hard to make out anything happening on the guitars or vocals. It's extremely technical in a low, chuggy, riffy way (as opposed to weedly-weedly). The riffs I can discern aren't all that memorable either. I saw someone in r/techdeath saying this album was better than 'Absolute Elsewhere' and I truly cannot fathom what crack they smoke. Different strokes for different folks i guess - clearly some people like this but I'm heavily leaning toward recommending to just skip this one. UPDATE: Yea man i could not finish"
10/4,Krosis,LP,Infinite Circuitry,Technical Death Metal,8.6,"Super fast paced, super techincal, lots of fun. No major complaints - masterfully executed, sounds great, really nails the sound they're going for. If I had to nitpick, I could say it's a little monotonous (though there is a cool ballad thing toward the end), but this didn't really bother me all that much because it's such a quick listen. Tech Death bros should absolutely check this out."
10/4,Mother of Millions,LP,Magna Mater,Progressive Metal,,
10/4,Undeath,LP,More Insane,Death Metal,7.1,"Pretty good pure death metal release. Some great riffing, nasty vocals, good production, and high intensity. Doesn't break the mold or anything, but just a really, really solid delivery on those classic death metal sounds. I'd recommend this to any big death metal fans. It's a quick 33 minutes - doesn't hang around longer than it needs to."
10/4,Godspeed You! Black Emperor,LP,"""NO TITLE AS OF 13 FEBRUARY 2024 28,340 DEAD""",,,
10/9,No Oath,LP,Therma,Instrumental Metalcore,7.2,"Pretty nice! This is a cool style of instrumetal that I can't say I've heard before. Highly rhythmic with soaring melodic lines on top. I vibed out and enjoyed from start to finish. I will say, my ear is not used to the bass guitar/bass drum CLIPPING that hard. It's weird, it's like it clips the entire waveform every time the bass drum is hit. Not a fan personally, but I could see others enjoying this."
10/11,Andy Gillion,LP,Exilium,Melodic Death Metal,,
10/11,Master Boot Record,LP,Hardwarez,Industrial Metal,,
10/11,Oranssi Pazuzu,LP,Muuntautuja,Psychedelic Black Metal,6.6,"Definitely a very intereseting style. I'm not sure I'd call it psychadelic black metal, but I'm not really sure what else to call it. It's a weird mix of electronic, synth, and raw black metal. Theres a weird intensity fused with a kind of chill, foreboding atmosphere. If you're into weird black metal, I think you should check this out. I can't say I loved it... but I didn't hate it? Will not listen again."
10/11,Hell Is Other People,LP,Moirae,Post Black Metal,,
10/11,Mist From The Mountains,LP,Portal - The Gathering Of Storms,Melodic Black Metal,,
10/11,Planet Of Zeus,LP,Afterlife,Stoner Metal,7.1,"Not too shabby - I enjoyed enough to get all the way through. The tracks are pretty short and a little repetitive at times, but dig the style. Not a 'must-listen' for the stoner/sludge fans, but I think its a solid release if you're thirsting for that sound. Give it a shot, pal."
10/11,Motorhead,EP,The Bomber Demos,New Wave of British Heavy Metal,7.0,"Damn, Motorhead really was ahead of their time. These are the demo tapes from their 1979 album 'Bomber'. Motorhead was never my favorite band from that era, but they had a handful of pretty kickass songs. They played so fast and so raw, really nailed that style that we've all come to know. I'd probably only recommend this if you're a big Motorhead fan, or would enjoy a brief trip back in time."
10/16,CANDY,EP,Flipping,Hardcore,,Accidentally overwrite whatever I had for this - i remember not liking it.
10/17,Akphaezya,LP,"Fell Down The Veil (Anthologies I,III & V)",Avantegarde,5.5,"Very bizarre album. There are parts I like, and some parts that I really, really don't like - chiefly, the lead vocals. I'm sure it's intentional, but she essentially sounds off-key for the entire album. There are some cool tracks thrown around, but it's all a little too 'weird' and disorganized for me to really understand. Maybe i'm just ape brained and too dumb for this one. The bass line on track 2 or 3 signifies that clearly the band knows how to play and compose, and overall execution is decent (aside from vocals?)."
10/18,Ensiferum,LP,Winter Storm,Extreme Folk Metal,,
10/18,Swallow The Sun,LP,Shining,Progressive Black Metal,7.2,"I remember really liking their 2019 album, but honestly found myself zoning out a lot on this one. It's not bad at all - definitely has a very distinct, chill, melancholic sound to it. And really, I'm not trying to shit on this too much - it's a solid release. I think I just got a little bored with it. I think this is certainly up many peoples' alley. Give it a check if you'd like some interesting, prog black in your diet."
10/18,Carnosus,LP,Wormtales,Technical Death Metal,8.6,"This is some real sick shit. Frankly some of the tightest riffing I've heard in tech-death lately. The vocals are crisp and fast, the riffing goes between blitzing insanity and rhythmic head-banging.  The musicianship is just on another level here. This is absolutely a must-listen for tech-deathers. All-in-all it's just stylistically/sonically maybe not hitting as hard for me? But it's just personal preference - these guys killed it."
10/18,Kiko Loureiro,LP,Theory of Mind,Progressive Instrumetal,8.0,"This is really solid stuff. Really awesome, soaring guitar melodies atop some intricate rhythms and chords. I have a stylistic issue with a lot of instrumetal where by dumb baby brain get bored fast, but this felt a lot more on the Marty Friedman side of things - I was constantly engaged and entertained. I tuned out a little toward the end, but overall a very solid listen, and I would definitely recommend it to fans of Marty Friedman's recent stuff."
10/18,Five The Hierophant,LP,Apeiron,Avante Garde,6.0,"Sax metal, sax metal. It's got a few things I like, but lacking something things that I need. Songs feel a little aimless and stagnant, sax is awesome of course, guitar tone is a little crunchy for my taste, melodies are a bit weak too. It's an interesting listen for the prog-minded, but you're really not missing much if you skip."
10/18,Leviathan Project,EP,"Phantoms, Vol.2",Progressive Metal,,
10/18,Saddayah,EP,LILA,Death Metal,,
10/21,The Circle of Wonders,LP,IV: Timber,Progressive Rock,7.7,"Hooooowee, what a ride. This dude is just an absolute machine at pumping out kickass melody after kickass melody. While I don't think this release quite hit the same level as his previous, this is still an awesome listen that you will enjoy if you're a fan of his work. I'll 100% be re-listening in the coming days. Well done, Cody."
10/25,Fit For An Autopsy,LP,The Nothing That Is,Deathcore,9.1,"This is a *really* strong release. In many ways it carries the torch from their previous album, but in others it iterates their sound and adds something new. There is a distinct focus on clean vocals here that I haven't heard from the group before. As usual, the riffs hit, the vocals are flawless, lyrics scarring, and flow immaculate. Incredible job fellas, what a release."
10/25,Gigan,LP,Anomalous Abstractigate Infinitessimus,Technical Death Metal,5.8,"I respect the instrumentation, but I'm having a really hard time getting past how noisy the album is. The guitars are absolutely blitzing, but I have kind of a hard time making out what's happening. Theres a song in the middle that is literally just an extended noise-jam session. Idk I'm a little dissapointed because I love the horror/sci-fi tech death, but I think this might be just a little too far out of my comfort zone. If you like blinding fast and techincal musicianship with some nast gutterals on top, check this one out."/
10/25,Waste,LP,In Decay,,5.1,"Yea really felt the same as their earlier release this year. Same notes, same verdict."
10/25,Iotunn,LP,Kinship,Progressive Death Metal,7.0,"I'm so conflicted - on paper I should absolutely love this album. It reminds me a lot of Barren Earth and Countless Skies, both of which I love. Something just... is not connecting with me for some reason. I literally have no negative notes to give - I think maybe it just didn't strike that exact sweet spot for me. I'm saddened because I'm not even really drawn to listen again. I think this is a must listen for fans of extreme prog - hopefully it hits you harder than it did me."
10/25,Devin Townsend,LP,PowerNerd,Progressive Metal,,
10/25,Schammasch,LP,The Maldoror Chants: Old Ocean,Black Metal,,
10/25,Antipope,LP,Doors Of The Dead,Heavy Metal,5.1,"Hard to pin down what exactly this is - heavy metal, not fast enough to be speed metal, not harsh enough to be thrash, not prog enough to be prog... it sits just slightly far enough away from classic heavy metal that I wouldn't call it that, but I wouldn't really call it anything else either. Regardless, I'm not really a fan. Don't love the vocals, don't love the style, really just don't vibe with it much at all. It's not bad - well executed and they clearly have a unique-ish style... idk I'd skip."
10/25,Better Lovers,LP,Highly Irresponsible,Progressive Hardcore,6.2,"Bonkers, off the wall, ass beating music. I can't say I was fully on board throughout my listen, but I appreciate and respect the artistry and execution. Lots of riffing, not too much in the way of melodic lines, and a lot of the songs started to bleed together to me. It's extremely chaotic and fun, but I think it's a pretty small subset of people that would be very into this."
10/25,Lostregos,LP,Nai,Pagan Metal,,
10/25,Omnerod,EP,Panspermia,Extreme Progressive Metal,9.1,"Wow, love this. I think I've kind of slept on Omnerod. I liked their last album 'Amensal Rise' but it didn't super hit me. I'm thinking now I need to go back and check it out. It's heavy, it's brave, it changes pace, and overall just kept me super engaged throughout. Heavily recommend for anyone of a progressive disposition, especially if you like some fuckin NAST in your prog. Check it out. EDIT - I've found myself listening to this over and over again. Probably gonna be my EP of the year which is crazy because 'Poetic Edda' absolutely blasted. whent from 7.6 to 9.1"
10/25,Methadone Skies,LP,Spectres at Dawn,Stoner Metal,7,"Pretty good stuff! Nice riffing, great vibes, really locked in and fun. Nothing that'll blow you away, but a great listen while working - insrumentals really help me focus in. I'd check it out if you like stoner, riff heavy vibes. "

10/28,"Tyler, The Creator",LP,CHROMAKOPIA,Hip Hop,,
10/31,Theurgy,LP,Emanations Of Uncioncious Luminescence,Technical Death Metal,4.8,"The instrumentation, guitar/bass work, drumming, etc, are all truly top notch. I think stylistically it might not be my favorite thing - there isn't a ton of riffing or repetition for your ear to latch onto and understand. My major hangup is the vocals.... guys do people actually like this? He literally sounds like he's 'oinking' into the microphone. It just completely ruins it for me - I simply can't get past it."

11/1,Abomination,EP,Abomination,Melodic Death Metal,,
11/1,Mitochondrion,LP,Vitriseptome,Blackened Death Metal,3.5,"Umm yea man - 90 minutes of blackened, dissonant death metal is about as close as it gets to my living nightmare. Look, this is gonna be heavily hampered by my inability to enjoy disso-death. But even so, I just don't think this is very well executed. It's sooooo long, soooo winding, and sooo repetitive. I really can't recommend this at all. To anyone. I'm sorry band"
11/1,Havok,EP,New Eyes,Thrash Metal,6.8,"Havok being Havok! Great band, doesn't miss, always fun to listen to. I think this is an easy recommend if you're into thrash. It's nothing crazy, new, or groundbreaking, but it scratches that itch a little bit. Fun little Metallica cover at the end!"
11/1,Etherius,LP,Hymns Of The Crimson Raven,Progressive Instrumental Metal,,
11/1,VOLA,LP,Friend Of A Phantom,Progressive Metal,,
11/1,Cane Hill,LP,a piece of me i never let you find.,Progressive Deathcore,6.9,"Idk I kinda dig it - didn't really resonate with my stylistically but it's really well done. I think for me, the songs started to bleed together a little, and I don't have a good enough ear for the sound to pick up on the distinct parts of each track. I think it's a solid listen and can easily recommend if you like djent-y deathcore with some slight progressive overtones and a lot of clean vocal harmonies."
11/1,Klone,LP,The Unseen,Alternate Progressive Metal,7.4,"Reeaally dig this sound. Feels a lot to me like Alice In Chains but a little heavier. It's honestly such a unique sound in the metal world that I'm having trouble thinking of how to describe it. Chill, somewhat melancholic, intricate. I think the only sin is that the songs start to bleed together a bit. I'd recommend - great change of pace."
11/1,Slughter the Giant,EP,Abomination,Technical Death Metal,,
11/8,Yoth Iria,LP,Blazing Inferno,Melodic Black Metal,5.5,"Not bad, cool-ish blend of thrash, black, and melodic metal. Extremely monotonous which is a major hangup for me. I don't know - it's not bad but it's not good enough that I'd recommend it. It's well executed but there isn't much here that you couldn't find elsewhere."
11/8,The Browning,LP,OMNI,Deathcore,6.0,"Pretty wild, not really for me though. I can imagine the mega-rhythmic deathcore fans would get a big kick out of this. It has a lot of the same core elements, but with a distinct sound on top of it. Soft recommend to deathcore fans. It's very well executed. The song ""Come to Grips with Death and the End"" is a cool ballad toward the end."
11/8,Rivers Of Nihil,EP,Hierarchy,Technical Death Metal,6.6,"Look, I respect and appreciate the band's exploration into more technical, brutal sounds. However, this does (in my opinion) take away the thing that really made RoN special. This is a *fine* pure tech death release. I feel bad for the band because I remember how much backlash they got after releasing 'The Work' because it was ""not technical enough"". And here I am saying the new stuff is too techincal.... everyone's a critic huh. Good job guys, keep pumping out stuff and exploring."
11/8,Alarum,LP,Recontinue,Progressive Metal,8,"YO ok buddy I SEE you. This is awesome and prog dudes should notice it. Jazzy, fusion-y, death metal, big riffing, sweet rhythms, it's got it all. It's a little goofy, but damn is it fun. The execution is stellar, the songwriting is fun, I was transfixed from beginning to end. Progheads MUST listen."
11/8,Moss Upon The Skull,LP,Quest For The Secret Fire,Progressive Death Metal,,CHECK SPOTIFY LATER
11/8,Seven Kingdoms,EP,The Square,Power Metal,5.0,"Pretty boring power metal, but I'm not really a power metal guy. I guess it's well-ish executed and whatnot - songwriting is boring and repetitive, idk man I'd skip."
11/8,Kingfisher Sky,LP,Feeding The Wolves,Progressive Rock,5.9,"There are pretty cool parts, but most of it is not really hitting with me. I think the general songwriting and melodic lines are very week. I think prog-heads can skip this one safely - execution is fine, vocals a little repetitive, but overall not bad."
11/9,An Autumn,LP,Ethereal,Shoegaze,5.3,"Not my favorite sound. I kind of like the dreamy, synthy sounds, but they're not really hitting home for me. The somewhat grainy sound isn't really my favorite either. I feel like maybe 5 years ago I would have enjoyed this more, but now it was just a very mid listen from start to finish."
11/15,Poppy,LP,Negative Spaces,Alternative Metal,7.5,"Stumbled upon Poppy after she featured this year on the track 'Suffocate' by Knocked Loose. This is a cool sound! Can't say I have a good word to describe the genre - wildly heavy at times, chill and pretty pop at others, and a lot inbetween. She's clearly a very talented vocalist and songwriter, and the execution is top notch. I think I'll listen again at some point, but I'm not clamoring to go back right away. Regardless, this is a super unique tone that I think you should check out if you can tolerate pop and metalcore."
11/15,Thy Catafalque,LP,XII: A Gyönyörű Álmok Ezután Jönnek,Avantgarde Black Metal,8.6,"Dude this is the first time I've found myself SERIOUSLY fucking with Thy Catafalque. I've always only kind of enjoyed their stuff but never enough to go listen again casually. Now I need to revisit their discography and see if my tastes have changed. Theres plenty of variation and keeps the album fresh - it honestly went by really fast. Great writing, great sounds, great vox, must listen for prog dudes (as long as you're cool with harsh vocals)"
11/15,Veilburner,LP,The Duality Of Decapitation And Wisdom,Experimental Black Metal,4.9,"Um points for creativity I guess. This was a tough listen for me - it's very weird and experimental in certain ways, but I didn't really enjoy any of it. Vocals were annoying, guitar felt like an after thought (though there were a few good riffing sections) and the songs didn't feel like they went anywhere. I'd skip if I were you."

11/15,Mammoth Grinder,EP,Undying Spectral Resonance,Death Metal,6.2,"Not terrible, not great. I like the darker, more raw tone, but that's about it. It's pretty bog standard death metal - would have felt right at home if it was released 30 years ago."
11/22,Opeth,LP,The Last Will And Testament,Progressive Metal,9.2,"I have been WAITING. Ohhhhohohoho buuuddddyyyyyy you can't do this to me when I'm this busy at work. This will absolutely be receiving another spin from me today, but my initial impressions were pretty good. They did a fantastic job at merging their heavy, harsh vocals and sound with the prog-rock tones that they've been working on for the last 10-ish years. This is a must listen for anyone even moderately into Opeth or progressive death. EDIT: relistend a few times now, and it's only getting better with age. Theres so much going on - so much variety and pace changes. Really great release - Opeth did not dissapoint."
11/22,Defeated Sanity,LP,Chronicles Of Lunacy,Brutal Death Metal,4.8,"I was hearing high praises for this, but i guess i just truly cannot get past the brtual. No more brutal in the future for me, I'm tired of having to dish out low ratings for a genre I just clearly can't appreciate. I'd skip, but apparently this is the real deal for the technical, brutal death metal world."
11/22,Silent Winter,LP,Utopia,Progressive Power Metal,,
11/22,Body Count,LP,Merciless,Crossover Thrash,8.4,"Honestly this is just great. It's such a fun listen, and Ice-T legitimately brings a unique spin to a classic metal sound. The features are killer, the riffing legit goes hard, the song-to-song variation is better than most metal bands... I mean theres a Comfortably Numb cover... WITH DAVID GILMOUR for gods sake. For what it is, it is border-line perfect. The atrocious album art really reminds me of cheap thrash/crossover albums from the 90s haha. If you're looking for something in a different vein, definitely give this a rip."

11/22,M​ú​r,LP,M​ú​r,Progressive Metal,8.9,"Really awesome listen. The tone and style changes with virtually every song. First track 'Eldhaf' reminds me a LOT of 'Deadhead' by Devin Townsend, and then right into track 2 'Mur' has harsh growls and gnarly riffs. The production is immaculate, the vocals are fantastic, the instrumentation is on point. I really don't have any criticisms aside from just personal preferences. Very, very solid release that proggers need to listen to."
11/22,Pestilectomy,LP,Soundtrack to an Embalming Room,Brutal Death Metal,4.0,Yerp
11/22,Kendrick Lamar,LP,GNX,Hip Hop,,"I'm absolutely loving Kendrick's progression over the last several albums. Every single release is a completely new vibe with a different iteration on his core sound. Here, we get to see him ANGRY. I will listen again and complete this micro-review."
11/27,Infectious Jelqing,LP,THEM YOUNG WIGGAS,Slam Metal,6.9,"Good memes fellas, good memes. Is it fun? Of course. Does it occasionally have some hard riffs? Without a doubt. Is it good music? Probably not. I'm not even gonna start to criticize this because it is so obviously a bunch of guys having a grand 'ol time. But you can probably skip this unless you're really into slam. Every song is loaded with funny sound bytes - so maybe check out a song or two if you're curious."
11/29,Mifitis,LP,The Skorian // The Greyleer,Black Metal,6.0,"Mostly mid with a couple of stand-out moments. The riffing itself was ok and had good parts, the songwriting was meh, the vox were fine, the best part in my opinion were some of the symphonic/synthy components. Didn't strike much of a chord with me overall. Well executed and maybe worth a listen if you're into black metal that's a little off the beaten path."
11/29,Bedsore,LP,Dreaming The Strife For Love,Progressive Black Metal,7.9,"With a name like 'Bedsore' and album art like this, I was fully prepared for some nasty death metal. I was shocked when the opening track hit me with 70's prog-rock vibes! Overally, a pretty enjoyable listen - fun progressive elements, cool arrangements and songwriting, lots of variety. At the end It was starting to feel a bit repetitive and played out, but this is definitely a must listen for prog nerds. Very unique style that shouldn't be ignored."
11/29,Maladie,LP,Symptoms IV,Progressive Black Metal,5.1,"Not my cup of tea, felt kind of aimless. Clean vox didn't really do it for me, riffing wasn't all that great, the synth protions felt wandering and without-intention. The progressive elements felt very phoned in overall. The execution seems to be decent enough - I think it's just a songwriting and stylistic thing for me. Probably skip this one."
11/29,Ulver,LP,Liminal Albums,Avantegarde Electronic,,"I'm actually so fucking mad about the wacky release of this album - I legitimately have thought this was released three times previously this year. First as an EP (didn't know it was just a teaser EP), followed by the 'Hollywood Babylon' EP, and then again with 'The Red Light' which is an... album... with a bunch of the same tracks? I have no idea whats going on. Ulver is great and the tunes rock but holy shit release shit ONCE"
